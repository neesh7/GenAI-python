## Agentic Architecture & Orchestration (16 questions)

Question 1
Skipped
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. During a run on regional climate adaptation funding, the document analysis subagent finds two credible government reports with incompatible cost estimates. The synthesis agent cannot determine whether the difference reflects methodology, geography, or time period. Current escalation tickets only say "conflicting sources found," and human reviewers must restart the investigation from scratch. What change would best improve this mid-process escalation?
Have the report generator omit contested sections from final reports and notify reviewers only after unrelated sections finish.
Explanation
Omitting contested sections hides important coverage gaps and weakens the final report's transparency. Delaying reviewer involvement also prevents timely resolution of the exact issue blocking accurate synthesis.
Attach the complete coordinator and subagent transcript so reviewers can reconstruct the investigation without model summarization.
Explanation
A full transcript is verbose and shifts the burden of reconstruction onto the human reviewer. It also fails to highlight the specific unresolved claims, source evidence, and decision needed at escalation time.
Correct answer
Generate a structured handoff with research topic, disputed claims, source citations, analysis performed, and recommended reviewer decisions.
Explanation
A structured handoff gives the human reviewer the context needed to continue from the system's work instead of restarting the investigation. It captures the unresolved decision point, supporting evidence, prior analysis, and recommended next steps in a compact, actionable format.
Ask the synthesis agent to choose the most plausible estimate and escalate only when its confidence score is low.
Explanation
Forcing a choice between conflicting credible sources can hide uncertainty and produce misleading reports. Self-reported confidence is not a reliable escalation criterion when the underlying issue is unresolved evidence conflict.
Overall explanation
Structured handoffs are essential when a multi-step workflow needs human intervention mid-process, especially when reviewers do not have the full working context. The handoff should preserve the research question, disputed claims, source citations, what the agents already tried, why the system could not resolve the issue, and what decision or investigation the reviewer should perform next.

The underlying principle is continuity of work: escalation should transfer actionable state, not merely announce failure. In a multi-agent research system, this prevents duplicated investigation and preserves attribution across coordinator, analysis, synthesis, and reporting stages.

Sending an entire transcript is an anti-pattern because it is noisy and forces humans to rediscover the relevant facts. Choosing the most plausible value based on model confidence hides uncertainty, while omitting contested sections creates silent coverage gaps. Instead, unresolved evidence should be surfaced explicitly with provenance and a recommended review path.

Question 4
Skipped
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. A customer writes: "I need a refund for a damaged item, I was charged twice for another order, and I cannot access my account email." In testing, the agent often resolves only the first issue it investigates, then closes the case with an incomplete answer. When instructed to "handle everything," it sometimes mixes order details across issues or gives three disconnected replies. What workflow design best improves first-contact resolution for this pattern?
Process the customer's concerns strictly in message order, sending a separate final response after each tool result arrives.
Explanation
Strict sequential handling can work for dependent steps, but these concerns are independent enough to investigate separately once customer context is verified. Sending separate final responses also fragments the customer experience and increases the chance that unresolved issues are overlooked.
Correct answer
Create separate issue records after customer verification, investigate independent concerns using shared case facts, then synthesize one customer-facing resolution.
Explanation
This approach preserves the boundaries between distinct customer concerns while still using shared verified customer context. It enables independent investigation where appropriate and produces a unified response, which improves completeness without confusing facts across issues.
Choose the most urgent-looking concern based on wording intensity, resolve it first, and defer remaining concerns to humans.
Explanation
Using wording intensity as a proxy for priority is unreliable and can ignore important but neutrally phrased issues. Deferring remaining concerns to humans by default is unnecessary when the workflow can track distinct issues and synthesize a complete resolution.
Ask the customer to submit separate tickets for each concern before using backend tools or offering any resolution.
Explanation
Forcing separate tickets is an avoidable escalation pattern when the agent can handle multiple concerns in one case. This reduces first-contact resolution and shifts coordination burden to the customer without addressing the agent's context-mixing problem.
Overall explanation
Correct workflow design: Multi-concern customer messages should be decomposed into distinct issue records, such as damaged-item refund, duplicate charge, and account access. After customer verification, each independent concern can be investigated using the shared case facts, then the agent should synthesize a single customer-facing response that covers all resolved items and any remaining next steps.

Underlying principle: Multi-step support workflows need both separation of concerns and unified resolution. Separating issues prevents order IDs, refund amounts, and account details from being mixed across concerns, while final synthesis avoids making the customer manage multiple disconnected replies.

Strict message-order processing is less effective when concerns are independent because it adds latency and can lead to fragmented outputs. Asking for separate tickets or deferring unresolved concerns by default undermines the first-contact resolution target. Choosing issues based on wording intensity is an anti-pattern because sentiment or urgency cues are not reliable indicators of business priority or resolvability.

Question 18
Skipped
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. Last week, a long research investigation produced a draft report on a market topic. Since then, several source documents were replaced and the web index was refreshed. When the coordinator resumes the named investigation session, it repeatedly cites withdrawn documents and treats old search outputs as current, even after the user points out the updates. What should you do before continuing the report?
Resume the original session, remind the coordinator that some sources changed, and ask it to disregard outdated evidence.
Explanation
This keeps the stale tool outputs in the active context, where they can continue influencing the coordinator and subagents. Prompting the agent to ignore outdated evidence is less reliable than removing that evidence from the working context.
Fork the old session into separate branches, compare their reports, and select the branch with fewer citation conflicts.
Explanation
Forking is useful for exploring divergent approaches from a shared valid baseline, not for removing corrupted or outdated context. Each fork would inherit the same stale prior tool results, so comparing branches does not solve the underlying problem.
Continue the session until contradictions stop appearing, using a fixed maximum of five additional analysis iterations.
Explanation
A fixed iteration cap is an anti-pattern because it does not address why contradictions are occurring. The session can still contain obsolete evidence, and stopping after an arbitrary number of passes may leave invalid citations in the final report.
Correct answer
Start a new session, provide a structured summary of durable findings, and explicitly identify changed sources for fresh analysis.
Explanation
Starting fresh avoids carrying forward stale tool results that remain embedded in the prior conversation context. A structured summary preserves durable decisions and research scope while forcing current sources to be reloaded and reanalyzed.
Overall explanation
Starting fresh with a structured handoff is the most reliable approach when the previous session contains stale tool results or outdated source evidence. The new session can receive a compact summary of durable findings, open questions, source identifiers, and known changes, while avoiding the old conversation context that caused the coordinator to treat withdrawn documents as current.

The underlying principle is that session resumption is best when prior context is still mostly valid. When core evidence has changed, resuming can preserve harmful context, so a new session with explicit state injection provides a cleaner foundation for current analysis.

Simply telling the resumed coordinator to ignore outdated evidence relies on probabilistic compliance while leaving obsolete material in context. Forking the old session is intended for divergent exploration from a shared baseline, but it duplicates the stale baseline. Continuing until contradictions disappear with a fixed iteration count is also unreliable because it treats symptoms rather than removing invalid context.

Question 21
Skipped
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. A user asks for a report comparing how proposed AI copyright regulations affect music licensing, film post-production, and book publishing in the United States and European Union. Test runs produce reports that mix jurisdictions, duplicate background sections, and leave some industry-specific risks unresolved because the coordinator sends the whole prompt to one research pass before synthesis. What workflow change best improves coverage and consistency?
Send the full prompt to every subagent sequentially, asking each one to improve whatever the previous agent missed.
Explanation
Sequential full-prompt handoffs increase duplication and attention dilution because every agent must reason over the entire broad request. This does not create clear ownership for industry and jurisdiction coverage, so gaps and inconsistent framing can persist.
Correct answer
Split the request into distinct industry and jurisdiction workstreams, pass shared scope definitions, investigate in parallel, then synthesize one report.
Explanation
This addresses the root cause by giving each subagent a focused slice of the multi-concern request while preserving shared definitions and constraints. Parallel investigation improves coverage, and the final synthesis step resolves overlaps into a unified report rather than leaving fragmented outputs.
Run the broad research pass repeatedly until the synthesis agent reports high confidence that no topics remain missing.
Explanation
Self-reported confidence is an unreliable proxy for actual coverage, especially when the same broad prompt keeps producing similar omissions. Repeating an unfocused pass wastes work and does not guarantee that neglected industries or jurisdictions receive dedicated investigation.
Let subagents negotiate scope directly with each other, then have the coordinator accept whichever division they choose.
Explanation
Direct subagent-to-subagent negotiation weakens the coordinator's role in controlled routing, observability, and consistent error handling. It also makes the scope division less auditable and can produce uneven coverage without a central plan.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: Multi-concern research requests should be decomposed into distinct workstreams, such as industry and jurisdiction slices, while giving each subagent the same shared scope definitions, date range, and reporting criteria. This lets agents investigate focused areas in parallel and gives the coordinator a structured basis for synthesizing a complete, consistent final report.

Underlying principle: In coordinator-subagent architectures, the coordinator should manage task decomposition, context distribution, and final aggregation. Broad prompts sent through one pass often cause attention dilution, duplicated background material, and unowned gaps, while focused parallel investigations improve coverage and make missing areas easier to detect.

Why the alternatives fail: Sequentially passing the entire prompt between agents does not assign clear ownership and often amplifies duplication. Allowing subagents to negotiate scope directly bypasses the coordinator's control plane for observability and error handling. Repeating the same broad pass until the model reports confidence is an anti-pattern because confidence does not reliably measure completeness.

Question 28
Skipped
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. A user asks for a report evaluating whether an organization should enter a new AI-assisted drug discovery market, covering scientific feasibility, regulatory exposure, partnership opportunities, and commercialization timing. In testing, the system often produces duplicated sections, misses relationships between findings, and takes longer than expected because each broad request is handled as a single chain of subagent calls. Which orchestration change would most effectively improve completeness and latency?
Ask the synthesis agent to resolve coverage gaps after receiving one broad search summary and one document summary.
Explanation
This delays gap detection until late in the workflow and gives the synthesis agent insufficient focused evidence for each concern. Synthesis can identify missing coverage, but it cannot reliably replace deliberate decomposition and targeted investigation.
Send the full request sequentially through every subagent, requiring each agent to append comments before report generation.
Explanation
A fixed sequential pipeline increases latency and does not focus each subagent on a specific concern. It also encourages duplicated commentary because every agent sees the entire broad request and may overlap with prior work.
Correct answer
Decompose the request into concern-specific tasks, run relevant subagents in parallel with shared context, then synthesize one integrated report.
Explanation
A multi-concern request should be split into distinct work items so each concern receives focused investigation. Running independent concerns in parallel improves latency, while shared context and final synthesis preserve coherence across the report.
Let subagents message each other directly, allowing whichever agent finds decisive evidence to produce the final report.
Explanation
Direct subagent communication reduces coordinator visibility and weakens controlled information flow. It also risks fragmented outputs because no single coordinator manages task boundaries, error handling, and final aggregation.
Overall explanation
Multi-concern requests benefit from decomposition into focused work items, such as scientific feasibility, regulatory exposure, partnerships, and commercialization timing. When those concerns are independent enough to investigate separately, the coordinator can run relevant subagents in parallel, pass shared framing to each one, and then combine the findings into a single coherent report.

The underlying tradeoff is between focused parallel investigation and a broad sequential chain. A fixed pipeline through every subagent is slower and often causes duplicated analysis, while direct subagent communication weakens observability and makes final aggregation harder. Asking the synthesis agent to patch gaps after broad upstream summaries is also brittle because missing evidence may never have been collected.

The reliable pattern is for the coordinator to define task boundaries, provide shared context, collect structured results, and synthesize a unified output. This preserves control while allowing parallel execution where the subtasks do not depend on each other. Learn more about agent orchestration patterns in the Agent SDK documentation.

Question 29
Skipped
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. During a pilot, the coordinator verifies a customer, retrieves two recent orders, and then delegates separate billing-dispute and returns-policy checks. The delegated analyses frequently state that the customer ID or order status is unknown, even though those facts were available earlier in the coordinator's turn. The coordinator currently sends each delegated check only a brief task title such as "evaluate refund eligibility." What change would most reliably improve the delegated analyses?
Correct answer
Include the relevant verified customer facts, order details, and prior tool outputs directly in every delegated Task prompt.
Explanation
Subagents operate with isolated context, so they can only reason over the information explicitly provided to them at invocation time. Including the relevant case facts and tool outputs in the Task prompt gives each delegated agent the context needed to produce accurate analysis without guessing or duplicating work.
Have subagents select customer and order records heuristically from names when required identifiers are missing from their prompts.
Explanation
Heuristic selection is an unsafe anti-pattern for support workflows involving identity, orders, and refunds. It can lead to misidentified accounts and incorrect resolutions instead of fixing the missing context problem.
Add few-shot examples instructing subagents to remember earlier coordinator turns during billing and return eligibility analysis.
Explanation
Few-shot examples can influence behavior, but they cannot give a subagent access to conversation history it did not receive. This approach incorrectly treats the issue as a prompting style problem rather than a context boundary problem.
Increase the coordinator's conversation token budget so earlier verification and order lookup results remain available in session.
Explanation
A larger coordinator context does not automatically make those facts available inside a separately invoked subagent. The relevant information must be passed into the subagent's prompt, not merely retained somewhere in the coordinator's session.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: In a coordinator-subagent design, delegated agents should receive the case facts they need directly in the Task prompt, including verified customer identifiers, relevant order records, and prior tool outputs. This works because subagents operate in isolated contexts and do not automatically see the coordinator's earlier conversation or tool results.

Architectural principle: The coordinator is responsible for packaging and routing context to each subagent so the system preserves accuracy, attribution, and task focus. Retaining facts in the coordinator's session or increasing token budget does not help if those facts are not included in the subagent invocation.

Why the alternatives fail: Few-shot examples cannot create memory across context boundaries, and heuristic customer or order selection is especially dangerous in support workflows where misidentification can cause financial or privacy errors. The reliable pattern is explicit context passing, not implied recall or guessing.

Question 30
Skipped
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. The coordinator has finished an initial literature map for a controversial research topic. Two stakeholders now want independently developed report outlines, one focused on regulatory risk and one focused on commercial opportunity. Both outlines should start from the same verified source set, but exploratory assumptions from either outline must not influence the other before final comparison. What should you do?
Start two fresh sessions with only the original user request, then let each branch rediscover relevant sources independently.
Explanation
Fresh sessions avoid contamination, but they discard the verified source baseline that both outlines are required to share. Rediscovery can introduce inconsistent source sets, duplicate work, and make comparison less reliable.
Continue in the existing coordinator session, alternate prompts for each framing, and instruct Claude to keep assumptions separate.
Explanation
This relies on prompt guidance to separate competing lines of reasoning inside one shared context. The existing session would accumulate assumptions from both framings, making contamination likely despite instructions to keep them separate.
Correct answer
Create separate fork_session branches from the completed analysis baseline, develop each framing independently, then compare outputs through the coordinator.
Explanation
Forking from a shared baseline preserves the same verified starting context while isolating divergent exploration paths. This fits the need to compare independent approaches without allowing assumptions from one branch to contaminate the other before synthesis.
Run both framing tasks in parallel Task calls that share a scratchpad file for notes and evolving assumptions.
Explanation
Parallel Task calls can be appropriate for independent subagent work, but a shared scratchpad defeats the isolation requirement. Allowing evolving assumptions from both branches into the same state creates exactly the cross-contamination the workflow must prevent.
Overall explanation
Fork-based session management is the right pattern when teams need to explore divergent approaches from a common, validated analysis baseline. A fork_session branch lets each research path inherit the same starting context while keeping subsequent reasoning, assumptions, and exploratory notes isolated until an intentional comparison step.

The underlying architectural principle is shared baseline, isolated exploration. This is different from ordinary parallel subagent execution, where subagents may run concurrently but still require careful context passing and state boundaries. When the goal is to compare alternative framings, isolation prevents one branch from anchoring or biasing the other.

Keeping both approaches in one coordinator session and merely asking Claude to separate assumptions is an anti-pattern because the conversation history remains shared. Starting completely fresh sessions avoids contamination but loses the verified source set, while a shared scratchpad introduces cross-branch state leakage.

Question 33
Skipped
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. A customer support agent has MCP tools `get_customer`, `lookup_order`, `process_refund`, and `escalate_to_human`. During a billing-dispute pilot, `get_customer` correctly verifies the caller, and `lookup_order` sometimes returns an order tied to a different customer ID because family members share names. The required workflow says refunds must only be issued when the verified customer ID matches the order owner, otherwise the case goes to a human. Logs show Claude usually follows this, but occasionally calls `process_refund` after a persuasive customer message. What change best improves reliability?
Strengthen the system prompt to emphasize that ownership mismatches always require escalation before any refund is issued.
Explanation
A stronger prompt can improve behavior, but it still relies on probabilistic compliance. The logs already show the model usually understands the rule but occasionally violates it, so prompt wording alone is not reliable enough for financial operations.
Correct answer
Add a stateful prerequisite gate that blocks process_refund unless verified customer and order owner IDs match, then escalates mismatches.
Explanation
This creates a deterministic control point outside the model's probabilistic reasoning. Since the required workflow depends on verified state from prior tool results, the gate directly prevents the unsafe downstream action when the prerequisite condition is not satisfied.
Add few-shot examples where persuasive customers with mismatched accounts receive apologies and are transferred without refunds.
Explanation
Few-shot examples can help clarify ambiguous escalation boundaries, but they do not enforce the required workflow. For an identity and ownership rule with financial consequences, examples should support the behavior rather than serve as the primary safeguard.
Parse the assistant response for phrases like verified owner before allowing process_refund to run in production.
Explanation
Parsing natural language as a control signal is brittle because the assistant may phrase the same state in many ways or omit the phrase entirely. Reliable workflow control should depend on structured tool results and application state, not generated explanatory text.
Overall explanation
Deterministic workflow enforcement is the right approach when a downstream action depends on a prerequisite business condition. In this case, the application should track verified customer identity and order ownership as structured state, then block process_refund unless those values match and route mismatches to escalate_to_human.

The underlying tradeoff is prompt guidance versus programmatic enforcement. Prompts and few-shot examples can communicate expectations, but they cannot guarantee that the model will always follow the required ordering or state checks, especially when customer wording is persuasive or emotionally charged.

Parsing assistant text for phrases such as verified owner is an explicit anti-pattern because generated language is not a stable interface. Production agentic workflows should use structured tool outputs, stateful prerequisites, hooks, or gates for rules that must not be violated.

Question 38
Skipped
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. Production review finds several billing dispute cases where the agent correctly verifies the customer and order, then attempts to call process_refund for amounts above your policy limit. Company policy allows autonomous refunds up to $500, but larger refunds require human approval before any financial action occurs. What change would most reliably prevent policy violations while preserving autonomous handling for allowed refunds?
Strengthen the system prompt with a mandatory refund limit rule and examples showing escalation for larger amounts.
Explanation
Prompt instructions and examples can improve behavior, but they still rely on probabilistic compliance. Because the failure involves financial policy enforcement, the system needs a deterministic guard before the tool executes.
Scan the assistant’s final text for refund amounts above $500 and create an audit alert after completion.
Explanation
Post-response scanning is too late because the refund tool may already have executed by the time the final text is generated. Parsing natural language output for compliance is also brittle and does not reliably prevent prohibited actions.
Correct answer
Add a tool call interception hook that blocks process_refund above $500 and returns guidance to call escalate_to_human.
Explanation
A tool call interception hook provides deterministic enforcement before the financial operation executes. It preserves normal autonomous refunds under the threshold while preventing policy-violating calls and redirecting the workflow to escalation.
Update the process_refund tool description to warn that refunds above $500 are forbidden without human approval.
Explanation
A clearer tool description can help the model choose and use tools more appropriately, but it does not enforce the business rule. The agent could still call the tool with an excessive amount, especially in ambiguous or multi-issue cases.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: A tool call interception hook is the right control point when a business rule must be enforced before an external action occurs. By blocking process_refund calls above $500 and returning guidance to use escalate_to_human, the agent can continue handling compliant refunds autonomously while guaranteeing that larger refunds do not execute without approval.

Underlying principle: Use deterministic enforcement for policy boundaries with financial, legal, or trust consequences. System prompts, few-shot examples, and tool descriptions are useful for steering behavior, but they cannot guarantee compliance in every turn.

Why the alternatives fail: Prompt-only and description-only approaches leave the model responsible for remembering and applying the rule, which is not sufficient for a hard policy limit. Scanning the final assistant message is an anti-pattern because it relies on brittle natural-language parsing and happens after the tool action may already be complete.

Question 41
Skipped
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. A coordinator delegates complex billing disputes to a case-investigation subagent. Logs show that when order data contains unusual combinations, such as a partial return plus a delayed replacement, the subagent follows the coordinator's embedded seven-step checklist exactly and returns incomplete conclusions instead of adapting. What change would most improve the delegation design?
Have the coordinator post-process incomplete subagent reports by guessing missing findings from customer tone and available message text.
Explanation
Guessing missing findings from tone is an anti-pattern because it substitutes unsupported inference for actual investigation. It also pushes correction downstream instead of improving the delegated work where the missing analysis originates.
Correct answer
Rewrite delegated Task prompts to state the support objective, constraints, case facts, and resolution quality criteria, leaving investigation paths flexible.
Explanation
This improves reliability by giving the subagent the context and success criteria needed to adapt its investigation to unusual case details. The coordinator still defines the goal and quality bar, but it avoids over-constraining the subagent with brittle procedural steps.
Keep the checklist but add instructions telling the subagent to ignore any step that seems irrelevant or outdated.
Explanation
This keeps the brittle checklist as the main control structure while asking the model to decide when to disregard it. That creates conflicting guidance and still relies on probabilistic interpretation instead of designing the delegation prompt around the desired outcome.
Create separate subagents for every order status so the coordinator can route each case to a fixed procedure.
Explanation
Over-specializing subagents by every possible status combination increases orchestration complexity and still fails when cases span multiple categories. The symptom is not lack of enough fixed procedures, it is that fixed procedures are preventing adaptive investigation.
Overall explanation
Effective subagent delegation gives subagents enough direction to succeed without turning them into rigid scripts. In practice, the coordinator should pass the relevant case facts, constraints, objective, and quality criteria in the Task prompt, then allow the specialized subagent to choose the investigation path appropriate to the evidence.

The underlying architectural principle is to use the coordinator for goal setting, context routing, and quality control, while preserving subagent adaptability for ambiguous support cases. A checklist can be useful as background guidance, but making it the core delegation contract causes failures when real cases do not match the expected sequence.

Keeping a checklist with vague escape clauses creates contradictory instructions, while creating many narrowly scoped subagents increases brittleness and operational complexity. Guessing missing findings from sentiment or message tone is especially risky because it fabricates certainty rather than recovering evidence through tools or targeted follow-up.

Question 42
Skipped
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. During load testing, broad topics often produce reports missing either web evidence or document evidence. Logs show the coordinator requested both search and document analysis in the same model response, but the next model input contains only one returned result before synthesis begins. What change best fixes the orchestration bug?
Treat preliminary report text as completion unless it contains explicit phrases like NEED_MORE_TOOLS or CONTINUE_RESEARCH.
Explanation
Parsing assistant text or sentinel phrases for loop control is an anti-pattern because the reliable signal is the API response metadata. A response can contain text alongside tool requests, so text content alone does not mean the agent is finished.
Serialize the workflow by preventing simultaneous subagent requests, requiring search, analysis, synthesis, and reporting in fixed order.
Explanation
A fixed sequence reduces adaptability and removes the benefit of parallel subagent execution for independent research tasks. It also treats the symptom by avoiding simultaneous requests rather than correctly handling all tool calls returned by the model.
Execute the first requested tool immediately, then ask the coordinator to reissue any remaining requests on the next turn.
Explanation
This drops valid tool requests that were already emitted and forces the model to reconstruct them later. It increases latency and can change the coordinator's plan, especially when multiple subagent calls were intended to run from the same response.
Correct answer
When the API response has stop_reason tool_use, execute all tool_use blocks, append matching results, and continue until end_turn.
Explanation
This implements the agentic loop around the model's explicit control signal rather than assumptions about response shape. Executing all requested tool calls and returning their matching results lets the coordinator reason over complete subagent outputs before deciding the next step.
Overall explanation
Correct loop control depends on the API response metadata: when stop_reason is tool_use, the orchestrator should execute the requested tools, return matching tool_result blocks, and continue the loop. When stop_reason is end_turn, the model has finished its turn and the application can present the final output.

In practice, a single assistant response can request multiple tools, such as parallel subagent calls for web search and document analysis. Executing only one requested tool causes incomplete context to be returned, so downstream synthesis may begin without all required evidence.

Forcing a fixed sequence sacrifices the model-driven planning that makes agentic research useful, and asking the coordinator to reissue ignored requests adds unnecessary latency and instability. Parsing natural language phrases or preliminary text for completion is especially brittle because tool requests and text can appear together in the same response.

The underlying principle is to treat tool use as a structured protocol, not as conversational text. Learn more in Tool Use and Agent SDK.

Question 45
Skipped
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. In a multi-agent research pipeline with a coordinator and specialized search, analysis, synthesis, and report agents, a prototype allows subagents to call one another whenever they need clarification. After several runs, audit logs are incomplete, retries are handled differently by each agent, and report outputs sometimes include findings the coordinator never reviewed. What architectural change would best improve reliability and observability?
Let subagents continue direct communication, but require each agent to append a natural-language summary after every handoff.
Explanation
Natural-language summaries may help readability, but they do not fix fragmented control flow or inconsistent recovery behavior. Direct peer-to-peer communication still bypasses the coordinator, making it harder to audit what happened and enforce consistent decisions.
Replace coordinator decisions with a fixed pipeline that always runs search, analysis, synthesis, and reporting sequentially.
Explanation
A fixed pipeline can be appropriate for predictable workflows, but it does not address uncontrolled communication among agents. It also reduces adaptability because the system always runs the same sequence regardless of topic complexity or intermediate findings.
Correct answer
Route subagent messages, errors, and follow-up requests through the coordinator, which manages delegation, recovery, and information flow.
Explanation
A coordinator-centered pattern gives one agent responsibility for routing information, tracking failures, and deciding what should happen next. This improves observability and consistency because every handoff, retry, and aggregation step passes through a single control point.
Give every subagent access to all research tools so each can independently recover from missing information.
Explanation
Broad tool access increases decision complexity and encourages agents to operate outside their specialization. It also worsens observability because subagents can independently take actions the coordinator did not request or review.
Overall explanation
Coordinator-subagent orchestration works best as a hub-and-spoke pattern: the coordinator manages delegation, inter-agent communication, error handling, and information routing. This keeps the system observable because every subagent result, failure, and follow-up request returns to a single place where recovery and aggregation decisions can be made.

Allowing subagents to communicate directly creates a peer-to-peer mesh that is difficult to audit and hard to control. Natural-language summaries do not provide deterministic routing or consistent error handling, and giving all agents broad tool access violates scoped specialization. A fixed sequential pipeline may simplify execution, but it sacrifices adaptive decomposition and still does not establish coordinator-managed handoffs.

The underlying principle is centralized coordination with specialized execution: subagents should focus on their assigned tasks, while the coordinator controls information flow and decides when to re-delegate or synthesize.

Question 47
Skipped
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. During a staging test, backend logs show that get_customer returns a verified customer record and lookup_order returns two eligible orders. On the next model request, the agent again asks the customer for the same identifiers and sometimes repeats the same lookup instead of deciding whether to refund or escalate. The tool executor is successfully calling the MCP tools and recording their outputs in server-side logs. What change most directly fixes this loop behavior?
Keep tool outputs in application state, then provide Claude a concise natural-language recap only after all tools finish.
Explanation
Server-side application state is not visible to Claude unless it is included in the conversation context. Waiting until all tools finish also breaks the model-driven loop, because Claude needs each tool result before deciding which action should come next.
Correct answer
Append each executed tool result to the conversation history using the matching tool_use_id before sending the next model request.
Explanation
Claude can only reason over information included in the messages sent on the next request. Returning each tool result with the matching tool_use_id lets the model connect the backend output to its requested tool call and decide the next action.
Run a predetermined get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund sequence and ignore intermediate model turns unless a tool fails.
Explanation
A fixed sequence removes Claude's ability to adapt based on tool outputs, such as multiple orders, ineligible refunds, or escalation needs. The scenario shows the model lacks the results, not that every case should follow the same hard-coded path.
Continue the loop until the assistant text says the request is resolved, then suppress further tool calls.
Explanation
Parsing assistant text for completion is an anti-pattern because natural-language wording is not a reliable control signal. The loop should be driven by structured response metadata and tool results, not by phrases that may vary across responses.
Overall explanation
Correct loop state handling requires returning executed tool results to Claude as part of the next conversation turn, using the corresponding tool_use_id. The model cannot see backend logs or local application variables unless those results are included in the messages you send back to the API.

The underlying principle is that each model request must contain the relevant conversation state. In an agentic loop, Claude requests a tool, your application executes it, then you send a tool_result block so Claude can incorporate the new facts and decide whether to call another tool or produce a final answer.

Keeping results only in application state, relying on assistant text as a completion signal, or forcing a fixed tool sequence all undermine reliable autonomous execution. The first hides necessary facts from Claude, the second uses an unreliable natural-language control signal, and the third replaces model-driven reasoning with a brittle workflow that cannot adapt to case-specific outcomes.

Question 51
Skipped
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. Research runs are meeting quality expectations, but they take too long. Logs show the coordinator assigns three independent investigation branches (market adoption, regulatory responses, and technical limitations) one after another, waiting for each subagent to finish before starting the next. The branches do not depend on each other's intermediate findings, and the coordinator still needs to aggregate results before synthesis. What change best reduces elapsed time while preserving the intended orchestration pattern?
Allow the market adoption subagent to invoke the regulatory and technical subagents directly, then return a merged result.
Explanation
Direct subagent-to-subagent invocation bypasses the coordinator's role in routing, observability, and consistent error handling. It can also make failures and provenance harder to track because information no longer flows through the central orchestration point.
Correct answer
Have the coordinator issue separate Task calls for independent research branches in one response, then aggregate their returned findings before synthesis.
Explanation
Independent subagent work can be launched concurrently when the coordinator emits multiple Task tool calls in the same response. This preserves the coordinator as the aggregation and routing point while reducing wall-clock time for branches that do not depend on each other.
Combine all branches into one broad Task prompt for a generalist subagent, then ask it to produce synthesis-ready findings.
Explanation
Combining independent branches into one broad subagent task reduces coordination overhead but increases attention dilution and weakens specialization. It also makes it harder to preserve distinct source coverage and attribution across research dimensions.
Keep the coordinator's sequential Task calls, but shorten each subagent prompt and cap each branch at one tool iteration.
Explanation
Shortening prompts and imposing an arbitrary iteration cap may reduce token usage or runtime, but it does not address unnecessary sequential execution. Arbitrary caps are an anti-pattern when used as the primary control mechanism because they can truncate valid investigation work.
Overall explanation
Concurrent subagent spawning is appropriate when delegated tasks are independent and do not require each other's intermediate results. In this situation, the coordinator can emit multiple Task tool calls in a single response, allowing the market, regulatory, and technical investigations to proceed concurrently while still returning their findings to the coordinator for aggregation and synthesis.

The underlying principle is to preserve the hub-and-spoke orchestration pattern while reducing avoidable wall-clock latency. The coordinator remains responsible for decomposition, result aggregation, provenance preservation, and deciding what synthesis receives, but it does not serialize work that has no dependency relationship.

Collapsing all research into one generalist subagent weakens specialization and increases the risk of shallow coverage. Letting subagents invoke each other directly undermines coordinator-controlled information flow and error handling. Keeping sequential calls while adding arbitrary iteration caps is also a poor tradeoff because it may reduce completeness without solving the core scheduling problem.

Question 56
Skipped
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. Production logs show that vague requests such as "my replacement and refund are both wrong" often require different investigation paths after the first backend lookup. Some turn out to be return-status issues, some are duplicate authorization holds, some involve account verification problems, and some combine multiple causes. A fixed workflow is producing unnecessary tool calls on simple cases and missing important branches on unusual cases. Which decomposition strategy should you use?
Correct answer
Begin with a brief fact-gathering pass, then let the coordinator create targeted follow-up subtasks as tool findings reveal the dispute type.
Explanation
This matches an open-ended investigation where the correct next steps depend on what is discovered during the case. A lightweight initial pass establishes the facts, then the coordinator can adapt the plan and delegate only the investigations needed for the actual dispute pattern.
Ask Claude to select one likely dispute category from the opening message, then execute only that category's standard workflow.
Explanation
Choosing a single category from the initial message is brittle because customers often describe symptoms incompletely or inaccurately. It can prematurely narrow the investigation and miss mixed cases where billing, return status, and account state interact.
Run every vague case through a fixed sequence covering billing, returns, account access, and refunds before generating the final response.
Explanation
A fixed exhaustive sequence wastes tool calls on simple cases and still may not cover unusual combinations that emerge from intermediate findings. This approach is better suited to predictable workflows with known steps, not ambiguous support investigations with branching causes.
Set a maximum of three investigation steps, escalating any case that still lacks a clear resolution after the cap.
Explanation
An arbitrary step cap is an anti-pattern because it treats loop length as a proxy for case complexity or correctness. Some cases need more than three targeted checks, while others should escalate earlier due to policy gaps or explicit customer preference.
Overall explanation
Adaptive decomposition is the best fit when a support case starts ambiguous and the right path depends on intermediate tool results. A brief fact-gathering pass gives the coordinator enough context to decide whether to investigate billing, returns, account access, or a combination, then delegate focused follow-up work and synthesize a unified resolution.

The underlying tradeoff is between predictability and adaptability. Fixed prompt chains work well for predictable multi-step workflows, but open-ended investigations benefit from plans that evolve as facts are discovered.

Running every case through all possible checks increases latency and noise, selecting one category from the opening message risks premature narrowing, and using an arbitrary step cap can escalate solvable cases or continue unsuitable ones for too long. Escalation should be based on explicit criteria such as policy gaps, customer preference, or inability to make meaningful progress, not a generic iteration count.

Question 58
Skipped
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. A new refunds policy allows autonomous refunds up to $150. Anything above that amount requires human approval, regardless of customer history, sentiment, or how obvious the case appears. In staging, the agent usually follows the policy but occasionally calls <code>process_refund</code> for $175 after reasoning that the customer clearly qualifies. What change best meets the policy requirement before launch?
Add few-shot examples where the agent declines refunds above $150 and apologizes before continuing the support conversation.
Explanation
Few-shot examples can clarify intended behavior, but they do not create a hard boundary around backend actions. They are useful for calibration, not for guaranteeing compliance with a financial approval threshold.
Correct answer
Add a tool call interception hook that blocks process_refund above $150 and redirects the case to human escalation.
Explanation
A tool call interception hook provides deterministic enforcement before the refund action reaches the backend system. This is the right approach when a business rule must be guaranteed rather than merely encouraged through instructions.
Let the agent self-report confidence before each refund and escalate only when confidence falls below a fixed threshold.
Explanation
Self-reported confidence is an unreliable proxy for policy compliance and may be highest in cases where the agent confidently violates the rule. The requirement depends on refund amount, not the model's stated certainty.
Strengthen the system prompt to state that refunds above $150 must always be escalated before process_refund is used.
Explanation
Prompt instructions can improve behavior, but they remain probabilistic and cannot guarantee compliance. The staging failures already show that the agent can reason itself into violating the policy despite being instructed otherwise.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: For a hard business rule such as “no autonomous refunds above $150,” enforcement should happen at the tool boundary. A tool call interception hook can inspect the outgoing process_refund call, block policy-violating inputs before execution, and redirect the workflow to escalate_to_human.

Underlying principle: Hooks provide deterministic guarantees, while prompts and examples provide probabilistic behavioral guidance. When the cost of failure is financial, legal, or compliance-related, the architecture should prevent the action mechanically rather than hoping the model follows instructions every time.

Why the distractors fail: Stronger prompts and few-shot examples may reduce violations, but they cannot make violations impossible. A confidence-threshold approach is an anti-pattern because self-reported confidence is not calibrated to policy correctness, and the rule is based on a concrete amount threshold rather than uncertainty.

Question 5
Skipped
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. While updating refund-policy handling, you ask Claude Code to change a guard clause in a large tool adapter file. The attempted edit fails because the selected text appears in several similar handlers for returns, billing credits, and refunds. You need only the refund handler changed without altering adjacent cases. What should you do next?
Run Bash with a broad search-and-replace command targeting the repeated text throughout the support module.
Explanation
A broad search-and-replace is an anti-pattern for non-unique code snippets because it maximizes the chance of unintended edits. It bypasses the file-level context needed to preserve unrelated handlers that happen to share similar text.
Use Grep to locate all duplicates, then ask Claude to modify every matching snippet for consistency.
Explanation
Grep is useful for finding content, but changing every duplicate is not justified when only the refund handler should change. This would spread a targeted policy update into unrelated return or billing logic and create avoidable regressions.
Correct answer
Load the full file with Read, identify the intended refund block, then Write the complete corrected file.
Explanation
When a targeted edit cannot uniquely identify the text to replace, inspecting the full file provides the surrounding context needed to make a safe change. Writing the complete corrected file avoids accidentally modifying the wrong duplicate snippet while preserving the rest of the file intentionally.
Keep retrying Edit with the same replacement until Claude chooses the correct matching occurrence automatically.
Explanation
Retrying the same ambiguous edit does not add new information or resolve the non-unique anchor problem. It risks repeated failure or an accidental change to the wrong occurrence if the tool cannot distinguish the intended location.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: When a targeted Edit operation fails because the anchor text is not unique, the reliable fallback is to use Read to inspect the full file and then Write the corrected complete file. This gives Claude enough context to locate the intended block and avoids changing similar code in unrelated handlers.

Underlying principle: Built-in tools should be selected based on the operation's precision needs. Edit is appropriate for targeted modifications when the matching text is unique, while Read plus Write is safer when ambiguity prevents a reliable targeted edit.

Why the alternatives fail: Retrying the same ambiguous edit does not resolve the missing context. Using Grep to find duplicates can support investigation, but modifying every match violates the stated requirement to change only one handler. A broad Bash search-and-replace is especially risky because it performs mechanical changes without understanding which occurrence belongs to the refund path.

Question 11
Skipped
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. A researcher adds an internal corpus MCP server that exposes tools for searching licensed journals and exporting citation metadata. The coordinator uses it successfully on that researcher's laptop, but teammates running the same workflow see only the default tools and produce reports with weaker public web citations. The server needs to be part of the team's reproducible research setup without exposing credentials. What should you change?
Describe the server in CLAUDE.md and instruct the coordinator to request those research tools by name.
Explanation
CLAUDE.md can provide instructions and project context, but it does not register MCP servers or make tools available. Naming unavailable tools in prompts is an anti-pattern because the agent cannot call tools that were not configured and discovered.
Correct answer
Define the shared server in the repository's .mcp.json, using environment variable placeholders for credentials rather than committed secrets.
Explanation
Project-scoped MCP configuration is the right fit for shared team tooling because it travels with the repository. Environment variable placeholders allow each environment to supply its own credentials without committing sensitive values.
Add the server to each developer profile in ~/.claude.json, then document manual setup steps in the project README.
Explanation
User-level configuration is intended for personal or experimental MCP servers, not shared team tooling. This would preserve the current inconsistency because each developer must manually configure the server.
Let each subagent call generic web search when MCP tools are unavailable, avoiding repository-level server configuration.
Explanation
Falling back to generic web search hides the configuration problem and degrades citation quality for licensed journal research. It also makes results depend on incidental tool availability rather than a reproducible team setup.
Overall explanation
Project-scoped MCP configuration is the appropriate choice when an MCP server is part of a shared repository workflow. A repository-level .mcp.json makes the server discoverable for everyone using the project, while environment variable placeholders let each developer or automation environment provide credentials safely.

User-level configuration in ~/.claude.json is better suited to personal or experimental servers because it does not travel with the repository. Instructions in CLAUDE.md can guide behavior, but they cannot make unavailable MCP tools callable. Substituting generic web search is an anti-pattern because it masks misconfiguration and produces lower-quality, less reproducible research outputs.

The underlying principle is scope configuration to the collaboration boundary: shared team integrations belong at project scope, while personal tools belong at user scope. Learn more in the Claude Code Overview and the MCP Overview.

Question 12
Skipped
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. A report-generation subagent must update a shared Markdown template used for final research reports. The template contains the same phrase, "TODO: add source summary," in several sections, and repeated attempts to make a targeted replacement keep failing because the match is not unique. What should you do next?
Use Grep to locate every matching phrase, then replace all occurrences so the failed edit cannot recur.
Explanation
Grep is useful for finding content locations, but replacing every matching phrase ignores the requirement to update only the intended section. This would overcorrect the file and could damage other template sections that still need placeholders.
Use Bash with a scripted search-and-replace command to bypass Edit and update the template automatically.
Explanation
A scripted replacement can be fast, but it does not solve the ambiguity unless the script is carefully constrained by inspected file context. Bypassing the safer file workflow risks making the same wrong replacement more quickly.
Keep retrying Edit with broader surrounding text until one replacement succeeds without manually inspecting the full file.
Explanation
This is an anti-pattern because broader text does not guarantee the anchor is unique or that the correct section is changed. Repeated blind edits can accidentally modify the wrong occurrence and make the template less reliable.
Correct answer
Use Read to load the full template, modify the intended section, then Write the complete corrected file back.
Explanation
When a targeted edit cannot identify a unique match, loading the file and rewriting the complete corrected contents is the reliable fallback. This preserves control over exactly which repeated section changes, instead of depending on ambiguous text matching.
Overall explanation
Reliable file modification depends on choosing the right built-in tool pattern for the failure mode. When Edit cannot find a unique anchor because the same text appears multiple times, the safer fallback is to inspect the full file with Read, make the intended change in context, and replace the file using Write.

The underlying tradeoff is precision versus convenience. Edit is efficient for targeted changes when the match text is unique, but repeated placeholders or boilerplate make targeted matching unreliable. In that case, full-file replacement gives the agent explicit control over which section changes.

Blindly retrying broader edits, replacing every match, or using shell search-and-replace are anti-patterns when the problem is ambiguity. Those approaches may succeed mechanically while changing the wrong occurrence or damaging other parts of the report template.

Question 14

Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. During evaluation, the document analysis subagent sometimes initiates new web searches instead of analyzing the assigned PDFs, while the report generator occasionally rewrites evidence summaries before formatting them. Engineers added the extra tools to reduce coordinator round trips, but citation quality and role consistency have declined. What change best addresses the design issue?
Keep the broad tool access, but add stronger prompts telling each subagent to avoid using tools outside its primary role.
Explanation
Prompt instructions can improve behavior, but they do not reduce the underlying tool selection burden or prevent role drift reliably. When tool availability itself is the problem, scoped tool access is more robust than asking agents not to use available tools.
Correct answer
Restrict each subagent to role-relevant tools, adding only narrow cross-role utilities for frequent simple checks like source metadata lookup.
Explanation
Scoped tool access keeps each subagent focused on its specialization and reduces tool selection confusion. Allowing only narrow cross-role utilities for common simple needs preserves efficiency without letting subagents take over responsibilities better handled by other agents or the coordinator.
Move all tool access to the coordinator and require subagents to return plain text requests whenever they need information.
Explanation
Centralizing every tool call in the coordinator prevents misuse, but it creates unnecessary round trips for simple high-frequency checks. A better design keeps specialized tools with the appropriate subagents and allows narrow cross-role utilities where they provide clear value.
Give all subagents the same complete tool list so each agent can independently choose the fastest path to completion.
Explanation
Providing every subagent with all tools is an anti-pattern because it increases decision complexity and encourages cross-specialization misuse. The observed web searching and evidence rewriting are exactly the kind of role drift caused by overly broad tool access.
Overall explanation
Scoped tool access improves reliability by matching each subagent's tools to its actual responsibility: document analysis tools for the document analyzer, synthesis tools for the synthesizer, and reporting tools for the report generator. When a subagent frequently needs a small adjacent capability, such as checking source metadata, a narrow cross-role utility can reduce latency without collapsing role boundaries.

The underlying tradeoff is between autonomy and tool selection reliability. Giving every subagent every tool may seem flexible, but it increases decision complexity and causes agents to misuse tools outside their specialization. Moving every tool call to the coordinator overcorrects, increasing orchestration overhead even for simple repeated checks.

Stronger prompts alone are also insufficient because they leave the confusing tool surface unchanged. The more reliable architecture constrains tool availability first, then uses descriptions and prompts to guide selection within the appropriate scope.

Question 16

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. During a production incident review, logs show the message "Refund approval token missing" appears only after escalation handoffs. You need Claude Code to inspect the repository and identify every code path that emits or handles this message before changing anything. Which approach should you take first?
Correct answer
Use Grep to search repository contents for the exact error string and refund handler names, then Read matching files.
Explanation
Grep is the appropriate built-in tool for searching file contents, including exact error messages, function names, and import statements. Starting with content search narrows the investigation to relevant files before using Read to understand the surrounding code paths.
Use Glob to find refund-related filenames, then review only those files and skip content searches across unrelated paths.
Explanation
Glob is useful for matching file paths or filename patterns, not for finding text inside files. Restricting review to refund-named files can miss handlers, shared middleware, escalation adapters, or constants stored under unrelated filenames.
Use Edit to open likely refund modules one by one, searching manually before making targeted code changes.
Explanation
Edit is intended for targeted modifications using unique text matches, not for repository-wide investigation. Manually opening likely modules is slower and less reliable than searching all file contents for the known error text.
Read every support-agent source file into context, then ask Claude to identify where the error originates.
Explanation
Reading every source file upfront wastes context and increases the risk of attention dilution. A targeted content search is more reliable because it locates the exact references before loading surrounding files.
Overall explanation
Grep is the right starting point when the investigation depends on text inside files, such as an exact error message, function name, import statement, or constant. Searching repository contents first identifies the smallest relevant set of files, then Read can be used to inspect those files in context before any changes are made.

Glob and Read serve different purposes. Glob is useful for finding files by path or extension pattern, but it does not answer where a string appears inside code. Reading every file upfront is a context-management anti-pattern because verbose, irrelevant content can dilute attention and make later reasoning less reliable.

Edit is not an investigation tool. It is best used after you know the specific file and unique text to change. For debugging a production symptom, the sound workflow is targeted discovery first, contextual reading second, modification last.

Question 20
Skipped
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. A new MCP server exposes a working literature database tool that searches licensed journals and returns abstracts, DOI links, publication dates, and citation-ready source metadata. In test runs, the web-search subagent often uses general web search for peer-reviewed evidence, while the document-analysis subagent scans exported PDFs manually. The MCP tool appears in the available tool list, but its surfaced description is only "Search articles by query." What change should you make first?
Add coordinator instructions requiring academic prompts to include the word literature so keyword matching routes agents correctly.
Explanation
Keyword routing is brittle and can fail when users phrase requests differently or when non-academic tasks mention similar terms. It bypasses the model's ability to choose tools based on semantic task fit and does not improve the tool's discoverability.
Correct answer
Rewrite the MCP tool description to specify coverage, accepted queries, returned citation metadata, and when agents should prefer it.
Explanation
Tool descriptions are the primary signal Claude uses when deciding whether a tool is relevant. Expanding the description with capabilities, inputs, outputs, and boundaries helps agents choose the literature database when its curated metadata is the best fit.
Rename the tool to authoritative_research_supertool while leaving its inputs, outputs, and usage boundaries unchanged for stronger agent selection.
Explanation
A more dramatic name alone does not explain what the tool does, what it returns, or when to use it instead of alternatives. Ambiguous or promotional names can even increase misuse because the model still lacks operational boundaries.
Remove web search and file-search tools from all research subagents so the literature database becomes the only retrieval path.
Explanation
Removing other tools may force usage, but it reduces agent flexibility and can break workflows that legitimately require web sources or local documents. The problem is unreliable selection of a useful MCP tool, not evidence that every other retrieval tool is inappropriate.
Overall explanation
Effective MCP adoption starts with clear tool descriptions. When an MCP tool is connected and works manually but agents prefer generic alternatives, the first fix is to make the tool's purpose, inputs, outputs, and selection boundaries explicit. In this case, describing licensed journal coverage, accepted query formats, DOI and citation metadata, and when to prefer the tool over web search gives Claude the information needed for reliable tool choice.

The underlying principle is that MCP tools are still model-selected tools, so their descriptions function as the agent's interface contract. Restricting every other retrieval tool may create forced usage, but it harms legitimate workflows and masks the underlying selection problem. Keyword-based routing is an anti-pattern because it depends on phrasing rather than task semantics, and renaming without clarifying capabilities leaves the same ambiguity in place.

Question 23
Skipped
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. Production logs show two failure patterns in refund handling: intermittent gateway timeouts that often succeed on the next attempt, and permanent failures such as refund window expired or missing permission. Today the MCP tool sets <code>isError</code> and returns the same short failure message for both, so the agent sometimes repeats impossible operations and sometimes gives up on recoverable ones. What change best improves recovery behavior?
Configure the agent to retry every failed refund operation three times before showing the final error to the customer.
Explanation
A fixed retry count treats all failures as if they might recover, which wastes time on permanent business or permission failures. It also fails to encode why the failure happened, so the agent still cannot communicate or escalate intelligently.
Disable automatic retries for process_refund and escalate all failed refund attempts to avoid duplicate backend operations.
Explanation
This avoids duplicate attempts but sacrifices recovery for intermittent backend problems that could succeed on retry. Escalating every failure lowers first-contact resolution and ignores the observed distinction between recoverable and permanent failures.
Correct answer
Add errorCategory and isRetryable fields to tool failures, retrying only failures marked retryable and preserving user-facing explanations.
Explanation
This gives the agent enough structured information to choose the correct recovery path. Transient failures can be retried, while permanent business or permission failures can be explained or escalated without wasting attempts.
Have the agent inspect failure message wording for timeout or permission keywords before deciding whether another attempt is useful.
Explanation
Parsing natural language error text is brittle because wording can change and similar phrases may have different meanings. Recovery decisions should be driven by structured metadata, not keyword matching in human-readable messages.
Overall explanation
Structured error metadata lets the agent distinguish failures that should be retried from failures that require explanation, clarification, or escalation. In practice, the MCP tool should return an error result with machine-readable fields such as errorCategory and isRetryable, alongside a human-readable explanation the agent can use with the customer.

The key reliability principle is that retry behavior should be based on explicit semantics, not a generic failed status. Intermittent gateway timeouts are often worth retrying, while refund-window expiration and missing permission are not resolved by repeating the same tool call.

Fixed retry counts are an anti-pattern when used as the primary recovery strategy because they waste attempts on permanent failures and do not improve the agent's understanding. Parsing natural language error strings is also brittle, since wording changes can silently break recovery logic. Escalating all failures is overly conservative and undermines the first-contact resolution goal.

Question 36
Skipped
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. While updating the agent’s refund-policy behavior, you need to inspect only the files related to policy configuration and tests. The repository is large, and relevant files are spread across several packages with naming patterns such as return-policy.yaml, refund-policy.test.ts, and policy-overrides.json. What should you do first to locate the relevant files efficiently?
Use Grep for policy filename patterns across the repository, then Read every returned match before editing.
Explanation
Grep is designed for searching file contents, not for discovering files by path or extension pattern. It may miss files whose contents do not include the searched words, and it can return irrelevant files that merely mention the terms.
Use Bash to recursively list the repository, then inspect unstructured terminal output for policy filenames.
Explanation
A shell listing can sometimes work, but it is less direct than using the built-in path matching tool designed for this purpose. It also encourages noisy, unstructured output that can consume context unnecessarily.
Correct answer
Use Glob with targeted filename patterns, then Read only matching policy and test files before editing.
Explanation
Glob is the appropriate built-in tool when the selection criterion is the file path or filename pattern. It narrows the search space before using Read, which avoids loading unrelated repository content into context.
Use Read on each directory’s configuration files first, then manually decide which refund policy files matter.
Explanation
Reading broad sets of files upfront wastes context and increases the chance of attention dilution in a large repository. The better approach is to first narrow candidates by path pattern, then read only the relevant matches.
Overall explanation
Glob is the right first tool when the task is to find files by filename, extension, or path pattern. In this situation, the relevant evidence is encoded in names such as return-policy.yaml, refund-policy.test.ts, and policy-overrides.json, so the efficient workflow is to use Glob to identify candidate paths, then use Read on the small set of matches.

The underlying tradeoff is context efficiency. Reading broad directory contents or dumping a recursive shell listing pushes irrelevant information into the conversation, which can degrade reasoning on the actual policy change. Grep is valuable when searching file contents for function names, error messages, imports, or policy text, but it is the wrong primary tool when the selection criterion is the path itself.

Using Bash for simple file discovery is usually unnecessary when a more specific built-in tool exists. Effective Claude Code workflows use the most constrained tool that matches the job: Glob for path patterns, Grep for content search, and Read only after narrowing the target set.

Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. In the research pipeline, the report generator subagent is wasting context while locating reusable markdown templates and citation-style files. The team already knows the naming conventions for these files, but the subagent currently inspects broad directory contents before deciding what to read. Which approach best reduces unnecessary context while preserving accuracy?
Use Read on all files under the reports directory, then summarize away files that appear irrelevant.
Explanation
Reading all files upfront is a context management anti-pattern because it loads content before relevance is established. Summarizing irrelevant files after the fact does not recover the wasted context or reduce the chance of attention dilution.
Correct answer
Use Glob with the known path patterns to enumerate candidate template files, then Read only the selected matches.
Explanation
This approach uses the purpose-built file path matching tool before consuming file contents. It minimizes context usage by separating file discovery from content inspection, then reading only the files that are actually relevant.
Use Bash to run recursive directory listings, then have the subagent infer relevant templates from raw output.
Explanation
A shell listing can produce large, noisy output and requires the model to parse unstructured results. When the task is simple path pattern discovery, using a purpose-built built-in tool is more reliable and keeps the context cleaner.
Use Grep for template filenames across the repository, then Read every file returned by matching content lines.
Explanation
Grep is designed for searching file contents, not discovering files by path or extension pattern. It may miss files whose names match the convention but whose contents do not contain the searched terms, and it may return unrelated files that mention those terms.
Overall explanation
Glob is the right tool for path discovery. When the agent needs to find files by name, extension, or path pattern, it should first enumerate matching paths with Glob, then use Read only on the files selected for inspection.

The key architectural principle is to separate file discovery from content analysis. This keeps the report generator's context focused on relevant templates and citation files instead of filling the conversation with directory listings or unrelated file contents.

Grep is appropriate when searching inside file contents, not when matching filenames or extensions. Bash can list files, but it adds unnecessary command execution and often produces raw output the model must parse. Reading every file first is an explicit anti-pattern because it wastes tokens and increases attention dilution before relevance is known.

Question 46
Skipped
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. A newly connected returns-policy MCP server exposes a returns_helper tool. In production traces, the tool is discovered and works when manually forced, but the agent usually chains lookup_order, asks customers redundant policy questions, or escalates standard return cases. What is the best first change to improve adoption of this MCP capability?
Correct answer
Rewrite returns_helper MCP tool description to specify eligibility inputs, returned fields, examples, and boundaries with refund tools.
Explanation
Tool descriptions are the primary signal Claude uses to decide when and how to call MCP tools. Making the tool's purpose, inputs, outputs, examples, and boundaries explicit directly improves model-driven tool selection without adding brittle orchestration.
Merge returns_helper into process_refund so every refund attempt automatically computes eligibility before performing backend actions.
Explanation
Combining policy evaluation with a backend action blurs tool boundaries and increases the risk of accidental side effects. The issue is that the agent is not selecting the available capability reliably, not that policy checks and refund processing must become one operation.
Add a keyword router that invokes returns_helper whenever users mention return, exchange, refund, damaged, or late delivery.
Explanation
Keyword routing is brittle because similar words can imply different workflows, such as refund disputes, damage replacements, or shipping complaints. It bypasses Claude's natural language judgment and can create misrouting when customer language is ambiguous.
Force returns_helper with tool_choice at the start of every return conversation, then let Claude continue after receiving results.
Explanation
Forced tool selection is useful when a specific tool must run at a specific step, but it is too blunt for general tool adoption. It can cause unnecessary calls, bypass better model-driven sequencing, and does not teach the agent when the tool is appropriate.
Overall explanation
Clear MCP tool descriptions are critical because Claude uses tool metadata to decide which capability fits the current task. When a tool is visible and technically works when forced, but is rarely chosen in normal operation, the most direct first fix is to improve the tool description so it explains its purpose, accepted inputs, returned fields, examples, and boundaries relative to similar tools.

The underlying principle is to preserve model-driven tool selection while giving the model enough semantic information to choose correctly. Forcing the tool with tool_choice can be appropriate for deterministic first-step extraction or mandatory workflows, but using it at the start of every return conversation over-constrains the agent and may cause unnecessary or incorrectly ordered calls.

Keyword routers are an anti-pattern for ambiguous support language because terms like refund, return, damaged, and late delivery can map to different workflows depending on context. Merging a read-oriented policy helper into an action tool such as process_refund also weakens tool boundaries and can introduce side-effect risks.

Question 49
Skipped
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. During evaluation, the document-analysis subagent repeatedly calls an MCP tool to fetch the same unavailable source URL. Logs show the tool marks every failed fetch the same way, so the subagent retries permanent failures such as deleted documents and unsupported file formats, adding minutes of latency before the coordinator receives partial findings. What change would best improve recovery behavior?
Convert non-retryable failures into empty successful results so synthesis can continue without interruption or coordinator intervention.
Explanation
This silently suppresses failures and makes unavailable sources look like successful searches with no content. The coordinator and synthesis agent would lose visibility into coverage gaps, leading to incomplete reports without proper annotations.
Correct answer
Return errorCategory and isRetryable per failure, marking permanent source issues non-retryable and transient timeouts retryable with clear messages.
Explanation
This gives the subagent enough information to distinguish failures worth retrying from failures that require a different path. Marking permanent conditions as non-retryable prevents wasted attempts, while still allowing local recovery for transient failures such as timeouts.
Ask the coordinator to classify retryability from the tool's natural-language error text before deciding whether to rerun.
Explanation
Parsing natural-language error text is brittle and shifts deterministic failure classification away from the tool that has the best knowledge of the backend response. The tool should return explicit machine-readable retryability metadata so agents can make reliable recovery decisions.
Retry every failed fetch three times before reporting failure, since repeated attempts smooth over temporary provider instability.
Explanation
A fixed retry count treats all failures as if they might succeed later, which wastes time on permanent problems like deleted documents or unsupported formats. Arbitrary retry loops are especially harmful in multi-agent workflows because latency compounds across subagents.
Overall explanation
Structured retry metadata lets agents make practical recovery decisions without guessing. In this scenario, the MCP tool should distinguish permanent source problems from temporary access problems using fields such as errorCategory, isRetryable, and a clear human-readable description.

The key principle is that not all failures should trigger the same behavior. A timeout or temporary service unavailability may justify a local retry, while a deleted document, unsupported file type, or stable permission denial should be treated as non-retryable and surfaced to the coordinator with partial findings and coverage implications.

Fixed retry counts waste latency on failures that cannot succeed, while converting failures into empty success results hides coverage gaps from downstream synthesis. Asking the coordinator to infer retryability from prose is also brittle because it relies on natural-language parsing rather than explicit tool contracts.

## Claude Code Configuration & Workflows (12 questions)

Question 2
Skipped
Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. Your pilot review for database migration pull requests produces uneven feedback. Claude catches obvious syntax issues, but misses risks such as rollback safety, data retention, backward compatibility, and fixture setup because the team has not yet clarified what a good review should cover. You need to improve the workflow before enabling required CI checks. What should you do next?
Correct answer
Run an interview-style refinement pass where Claude asks maintainers targeted questions, then fold clarified criteria into the CI review prompt.
Explanation
This is the best next step because the problem is not just prompt wording, it is unclear requirements. Having Claude ask targeted questions helps surface assumptions and review criteria the team may not have considered before the CI workflow becomes mandatory.
Proceed with required CI enforcement now, using developer complaints from failed builds to discover missing criteria.
Explanation
Turning on enforcement before clarifying criteria risks blocking valid pull requests and eroding trust in the CI review. Developer complaints are useful feedback, but relying on production friction as the primary discovery mechanism is a reactive anti-pattern.
Create several examples from previous clean migrations, then require Claude to imitate those comments exactly during review.
Explanation
Examples can improve formatting and consistency, but clean migrations may not expose the edge cases the review must catch. Requiring exact imitation can also overfit the review behavior instead of helping the team discover missing decision criteria.
Add a broad instruction to be extremely thorough, then suppress review comments unless Claude reports high confidence.
Explanation
Vague instructions such as being thorough do not define which migration risks matter or how to classify them. Self-reported confidence is not a reliable substitute for explicit criteria, and it can still miss important issues or suppress useful findings.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: When the team has not yet clarified the important criteria, an interview-style refinement pass is a strong fit. Claude can ask maintainers targeted questions about rollback behavior, compatibility guarantees, fixture expectations, data retention, and other domain-specific risks, then those answers can be converted into explicit CI review guidance.

Underlying principle: Iterative refinement works best when the refinement method matches the failure mode. If Claude is missing issues because requirements are underspecified, the priority is to surface and structure the missing requirements before enforcing the workflow.

Why the alternatives fail: Vague instructions such as be thorough and confidence-based filtering do not create concrete review criteria. Few-shot examples are useful for format and ambiguous-case handling, but imitating clean examples will not reliably uncover hidden edge cases. Enabling required checks before criteria are stable creates avoidable false positives and developer distrust.

Question 8
Skipped
Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. A new CI review prompt loads the same repository guidance for every pull request. Review comments for generated API clients and database migrations now cite React accessibility rules and frontend naming standards, creating noisy false positives. The repository already keeps file-type conventions in separate markdown snippets, and you want Claude Code to consider each snippet only when the reviewed files are relevant. What should you configure?
Add every convention to root CLAUDE.md and instruct Claude to ignore sections unrelated to each pull request.
Explanation
This is an anti-pattern because it loads all guidance for every review and relies on the model to filter irrelevant sections. The noisy false positives already show that broad, always-loaded instructions are contaminating reviews for unrelated file types.
Place directory-level CLAUDE.md files near current source folders and duplicate rules for generated or relocated files.
Explanation
Directory-level CLAUDE.md files can scope instructions by folder, but they are weaker when conventions need to follow file patterns across locations. Duplicating guidance for generated or relocated files creates maintenance drift and can reintroduce inconsistent review behavior.
Correct answer
Create focused .claude/rules/ files with YAML frontmatter paths globs targeting generated clients, migrations, and frontend files.
Explanation
Path-specific rule files are designed for conditional convention loading based on file paths. YAML frontmatter paths fields with glob patterns let Claude Code load only the relevant guidance for matching files, reducing irrelevant context and false positive review comments.
Create separate project slash commands for each file type and require CI to choose one command before review.
Explanation
Project slash commands are useful for reusable workflows, but they are not the native mechanism for conditionally loading conventions by file path. This also moves responsibility into CI command selection, increasing orchestration complexity and risking mismatches when a pull request touches mixed file types.
Overall explanation
Path-specific rules are the right fit when Claude Code should load guidance only for files matching particular path patterns. Files in .claude/rules/ can use YAML frontmatter with paths glob patterns, which lets conventions activate conditionally instead of being injected into every CI review.

The underlying tradeoff is precision versus broad context. Keeping all guidance in a root CLAUDE.md increases token usage and asks the model to ignore irrelevant rules, which is exactly how unrelated React guidance can leak into migration or generated-client reviews.

Slash commands are better for invokable workflows, not automatic convention scoping by changed file. Directory-level CLAUDE.md files can help with folder-local standards, but duplicated rules are brittle when generated files, tests, or conventions span multiple locations.

Question 10
Skipped
Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. A new GitHub Actions step invokes <code>claude "Review the changed files for regressions"</code> and then stalls until the CI timeout. The repository checkout is valid, and the same prompt works when a developer runs it manually in a terminal. What change should you make to the pipeline command?
Redirect stdin from /dev/null so Claude Code cannot wait for additional input during the CI job.
Explanation
Redirecting stdin is a shell workaround, not the documented Claude Code interface for automated runs. It may change input behavior, but it does not put Claude Code into its intended non-interactive execution mode.
Add --output-format json and --json-schema so the runner receives a parseable response without prompts.
Explanation
Structured output flags are useful when CI needs machine-parseable findings, such as inline pull request comments. They do not, by themselves, address the interactive execution behavior that causes the job to stall.
Correct answer
Run Claude Code with the -p or --print flag so it processes the prompt and exits after output.
Explanation
Claude Code is interactive by default, which is useful in a terminal but inappropriate for automated CI jobs. The -p or --print flag is the documented way to run Claude Code from scripts so it produces output and exits without waiting for further input.
Append prompt instructions telling Claude to avoid follow-up questions and finish the review automatically.
Explanation
Prompt instructions are not a reliable way to control CLI process behavior in an automated pipeline. The hang is caused by how Claude Code is invoked, not by insufficient review instructions inside the prompt.
Overall explanation
Correct CI invocation: Claude Code is interactive by default, so automated runners should invoke it with -p or --print. This tells Claude Code to process the supplied prompt, write the result to standard output, and exit, which prevents CI jobs from waiting indefinitely for terminal interaction.

Underlying principle: CI/CD pipelines require deterministic process behavior. Use documented command-line execution modes for automation rather than relying on shell workarounds or prompt wording to influence whether a process remains interactive.

Why the other approaches fail: Redirecting stdin is an anti-pattern because it treats a CLI mode issue as a Unix stream issue. --output-format json and --json-schema are valuable for structured results, but they solve machine parsing, not interactive execution. Prompting Claude to avoid follow-up questions cannot reliably control whether the Claude Code CLI waits for input.

Question 17
Skipped
Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. Your repository's root CLAUDE.md has grown to 1,200 lines after adding review criteria, testing standards, API conventions, deployment notes, and migration guidance. CI-invoked Claude Code now produces noisy feedback that blends unrelated standards, and teams frequently create conflicting edits when updating guidance for their area. What restructuring approach best improves maintainability while preserving shared repository behavior?
Keep all guidance in root CLAUDE.md, but add stronger headings telling Claude to ignore sections unrelated to each pull request.
Explanation
Stronger headings may help readability, but the entire file still remains loaded as a large mixed-context instruction source. This is an anti-pattern because it relies on Claude selectively ignoring irrelevant guidance rather than reducing irrelevant context structurally.
Correct answer
Move narrowly scoped guidance into topic-specific files under .claude/rules/, leaving root CLAUDE.md with only universal CI review principles.
Explanation
Splitting a large instruction file into focused rule files improves maintainability by separating unrelated guidance into clear modules. Keeping only universal guidance in the root CLAUDE.md preserves shared repository behavior while reducing the chance that unrelated standards influence CI review output.
Move the CI review checklist into ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md on the build runner to reduce repository instruction size.
Explanation
User-level CLAUDE.md files are scoped to a specific user or environment and are not shared through the repository. Putting CI review guidance there would make behavior depend on runner configuration rather than version-controlled project configuration, reducing reproducibility for the team.
Copy the relevant paragraphs into each package's CLAUDE.md so every directory contains a complete local instruction set.
Explanation
Duplicating guidance across many directory-level files creates maintenance drift and increases the chance that different areas receive inconsistent standards. Directory-level CLAUDE.md files can be useful for local conventions, but copying complete instruction sets everywhere worsens the conflict and update problem described.
Overall explanation
Topic-specific modularization is the best fit when a repository-level CLAUDE.md becomes large, noisy, and hard to maintain. Moving focused guidance into files under .claude/rules/ lets teams organize standards such as testing, API conventions, and deployment guidance without forcing every concern into one monolithic memory file.

The architectural principle is reduce irrelevant context while preserving shared configuration. A concise root CLAUDE.md can hold universal CI review expectations, while focused rule files make ownership and updates clearer. This improves maintainability and reduces accidental cross-application of unrelated guidance.

Keeping one giant file with stronger headings is an anti-pattern because it asks Claude to ignore irrelevant material instead of structurally limiting what it must consider. Duplicating complete guidance across directory-level files creates drift, and moving shared CI instructions into ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md removes them from version-controlled project configuration.

Question 19
Skipped
Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. A new CI job asks Claude Code to improve coverage for a data normalization utility. The first generated tests pass, but they miss null inputs, timezone boundary cases, and duplicate IDs. Follow-up prompts like "be more thorough" produce inconsistent additions and occasional regressions. What workflow should you use to make improvement more reliable?
Ask Claude to assign confidence scores to each proposed test, then merge only cases above a fixed threshold.
Explanation
Self-reported confidence is not a reliable substitute for executing tests against defined expected behavior. A fixed confidence threshold can filter out useful cases or admit flawed ones without measuring actual correctness.
Correct answer
Create a targeted test suite for expected behavior and edge cases, then iterate by feeding Claude the specific failing results.
Explanation
This creates an objective feedback loop rather than relying on vague prompt refinement. Specific failing test results give Claude concrete evidence about what behavior is still incorrect, making each iteration focused and measurable.
Have CI randomly rerun Claude Code until generated tests cover the missed cases, stopping after three unsuccessful attempts.
Explanation
Random reruns and arbitrary attempt limits are anti-patterns because they do not communicate what failed or why. They may eventually produce different output, but they do not create a disciplined improvement process.
Rewrite the prompt to say be exhaustive and conservative, then accept only tests whose descriptions sound sufficiently precise.
Explanation
Vague instructions like exhaustive and conservative do not provide objective success criteria. Judging tests by whether their descriptions sound precise is a weak proxy for behavioral coverage and can still miss important edge cases.
Overall explanation
Test-driven iteration works because it gives Claude concrete, executable feedback. Instead of asking for generally better output, you define expected behavior and edge cases, run the tests, then provide the exact failures so Claude can make targeted corrections.

The underlying principle is to replace subjective review with an objective feedback loop. CI is especially well suited for this because test output, stack traces, assertion messages, and failing inputs can be fed back into the next Claude Code pass.

Vague instructions such as "be exhaustive" or "be conservative" often fail because they do not specify which behaviors are missing. Self-reported confidence scores are also unreliable unless calibrated against real outcomes, and random reruns with arbitrary limits waste cycles without improving the information available to the model.

Question 25
Skipped
Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. Your pull request review job has become noisy after teams added security audit steps, release-note checks, dependency migration guidance, and test generation procedures to the repository's main Claude instructions. Simple documentation-only PRs now receive irrelevant warnings, while specialized jobs still need the detailed procedures when explicitly run. What configuration approach best balances consistency with focused context?
Duplicate the complete workflow prompt inside each CI command, avoiding shared Claude Code configuration files entirely.
Explanation
Duplicating prompts across CI commands makes updates error-prone and increases the chance that review jobs diverge over time. It also misses the maintainability benefit of project configuration and reusable skills for repeatable workflows.
Store workflow instructions in user-scoped skills on the CI runner, updating them manually when jobs change.
Explanation
User-scoped skills are personal configuration, not the right place for shared repository workflows used by CI. Manual updates on the runner create drift and make behavior harder for developers to review or reproduce from version control.
Consolidate every CI checklist into root CLAUDE.md so each automated review receives identical instructions for maximum consistency.
Explanation
This is an anti-pattern because it loads irrelevant task-specific guidance into every Claude Code session. The symptom already shows that overloading the main instructions increases noise and false positives for simple pull requests.
Correct answer
Keep universal review principles in project CLAUDE.md, and move specialized CI workflows into project skills invoked by relevant jobs.
Explanation
This separates always-applicable guidance from task-specific procedures, reducing irrelevant context during routine CI reviews. Skills are appropriate for repeatable workflows that should be invoked when needed, while CLAUDE.md is better for universal standards that should affect every session.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: Use CLAUDE.md for guidance that should apply to every Claude Code session, such as universal review standards, severity definitions, and repository-wide conventions. Use skills for repeatable, task-specific workflows that should run only when invoked, such as a security audit, migration review, or specialized test generation pass.

The underlying tradeoff is context relevance versus consistency. Putting every workflow into always-loaded instructions may seem consistent, but it increases irrelevant context and can create false positives when a routine PR review receives guidance meant for a specialized job.

User-scoped skills are inappropriate for shared CI behavior because they are personal configuration and can drift from the repository. Duplicating large prompts across CI jobs is also brittle, since every checklist change must be copied to multiple places and reviewed for consistency.

Question 32
Skipped
Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. Your CI job asks Claude Code to review each pull request and then posts findings as inline comments. The posting step intermittently fails because some runs return markdown tables, others return bullet lists, and field names like file path, line number, severity, and remediation are phrased inconsistently. The team wants a low-maintenance fix that lets the pipeline reliably validate findings before posting them. What should you do?
Keep markdown output, then strengthen the parser with regular expressions covering every observed table and bullet format.
Explanation
Parsing natural language or markdown variants is brittle because future outputs may use new phrasing or formatting. This anti-pattern pushes reliability into an expanding parser instead of making Claude Code produce a stable interface for automation.
Correct answer
Configure Claude Code to emit structured JSON matching a schema containing required fields for inline review comments.
Explanation
Machine-parseable output is the right fit when downstream CI automation must validate and post findings reliably. A JSON schema gives the pipeline a stable contract for fields such as file path, line number, severity, and remediation, reducing failures caused by formatting variation.
Post Claude Code's raw review text as one general pull request comment instead of creating inline annotations.
Explanation
This avoids parser failures by removing inline posting, but it sacrifices the stated need for structured inline feedback. Developers would lose precise file and line annotations, and the pipeline would still lack reliable validation of individual findings.
Ask Claude Code to begin every finding with identical labels, then reject runs containing unexpected label text.
Explanation
Prompt wording can reduce variation, but it does not create a strong validation contract for CI systems. Rejecting runs after prose drift still causes avoidable pipeline failures and does not solve structured field validation cleanly.
Overall explanation
Structured CI integration works best when Claude Code output is treated as an automation contract, not as prose to be scraped. Using --output-format json together with --json-schema lets the pipeline require stable fields such as file path, line number, severity, and suggested fix before posting inline comments.

The underlying principle is that CI systems need machine-parseable, validated outputs. Markdown tables and bullet lists are useful for humans, but they are fragile integration formats because small wording or formatting changes can break parsers.

Regular-expression parsing and label policing are anti-patterns here because they rely on natural language consistency rather than a defined schema. Posting a single raw review comment avoids parsing, but it gives up the inline, structured feedback the workflow requires.

Question 34
Skipped
Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. A custom CI skill first inspects the repository's dependency graph, flaky test history, and prior pull request comments before producing review guidance. In recent runs, the main review output increasingly repeats exploratory notes from that setup phase, reports issues unrelated to the changed files, and sometimes misses straightforward diff-specific problems. What change would best preserve review focus while keeping the setup workflow available?
Correct answer
Configure the skill with context: fork so verbose exploration runs separately and returns only a concise summary.
Explanation
The context: fork setting runs the skill in an isolated sub-agent context, which prevents exploratory details from filling or biasing the main conversation. This preserves the useful setup workflow while allowing the main CI review to operate on a concise, relevant summary.
Increase the skill's argument-hint details so developers provide narrower module names and reduce exploratory output during invocation.
Explanation
Argument hints help users supply required parameters, but they do not isolate the skill's intermediate output from the main session. Narrower inputs may reduce volume somewhat, but they do not address the core issue of exploratory context affecting the review.
Have the CI prompt ignore earlier verbose notes and report only high-confidence findings from the pull request.
Explanation
This relies on prompt instructions to counteract polluted context, which is unreliable when the session has already accumulated distracting material. High-confidence filtering is also a vague proxy that can suppress useful findings without solving the context management problem.
Move the workflow into project-level CLAUDE.md so every review session consistently receives the same investigation instructions.
Explanation
CLAUDE.md is always-loaded context, so moving a verbose setup workflow there would make the context pollution problem worse. It is appropriate for universal standards, not for large exploratory procedures that should only run when needed.
Overall explanation
Isolating verbose skills is the right design when a workflow performs broad discovery but the main session needs to stay focused. In Claude Code skills, context: fork runs the skill in an isolated sub-agent context, allowing it to return a compact result without carrying all intermediate exploration into the main conversation.

The underlying tradeoff is between useful exploration and main-session context quality. CI code review often needs targeted attention on changed files and actionable findings, so preserving a clean review context helps reduce irrelevant comments and missed diff-specific issues.

Putting verbose workflows into CLAUDE.md makes them always loaded, which increases irrelevant context rather than reducing it. Adding argument-hint can improve invocation usability, but it does not isolate intermediate output. Prompting Claude to ignore earlier notes or rely on vague high-confidence criteria is an anti-pattern because it tries to repair context pollution after it has already occurred.

Question 39
Skipped
Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. During an automated pull request review, your team added a reusable repository impact analysis step before generating final findings. The step produces long dependency traces, rejected hypotheses, and intermediate notes. When the same Claude Code session continues into final review, the posted comments become noisy and sometimes cite exploratory dead ends instead of actionable issues. What configuration change best preserves final review quality while keeping the reusable analysis available?
Move the repository analysis instructions into the root CLAUDE.md so every CI invocation shares the same discovery context.
Explanation
CLAUDE.md is always-loaded project context, so putting verbose exploratory instructions there increases context usage for every CI invocation. This worsens the noise problem because the main review session still receives broad analysis guidance even when it is not needed.
Add a required manual /compact step after exploration, then continue the same session for final pull request feedback.
Explanation
Compaction can reduce context size during long sessions, but making it a required manual step is brittle for CI automation. It also keeps the workflow in the same session, so exploratory framing and summarized dead ends can still influence final findings.
Split the exploration into a separate slash command that writes findings directly into the main conversation transcript.
Explanation
A slash command can package reusable instructions, but writing verbose findings into the main transcript does not isolate the exploratory context. This preserves the root cause of noisy final feedback because the review still reasons over intermediate notes and rejected paths.
Correct answer
Configure the review helper as a skill with context: fork, returning only a concise summary to the main CI review.
Explanation
Skills can run in an isolated sub-agent context when configured with context: fork, which prevents verbose exploratory work from polluting the main conversation. Returning only a concise summary keeps the final review focused on actionable findings while preserving the reusable workflow.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: A Claude Code skill configured with context: fork is appropriate when a reusable workflow produces verbose exploration, broad codebase analysis, or speculative reasoning that should not dominate the main session. The forked context lets the skill do the heavy discovery work separately, then return a compact result for final CI review.

Architectural principle: CI review quality depends on keeping the final review context focused on decision-ready facts, criteria, and evidence. Isolating exploratory context reduces attention dilution and prevents rejected hypotheses from being treated as review findings.

Why the alternatives fail: Moving exploratory guidance into CLAUDE.md makes it always loaded, which increases noise for unrelated invocations. Relying on a manual /compact step is an automation anti-pattern and does not provide true context isolation. A separate slash command improves reuse, but if it writes all exploration into the same transcript, the final review remains polluted.

Explanation
This approach applies migration guidance based on file path patterns rather than physical directory hierarchy. It is maintainable when matching files are spread across multiple repository areas and avoids loading irrelevant guidance for unrelated CI reviews.
Move all migration review guidance into the root CLAUDE.md so every CI run consistently sees the rules.
Explanation
Putting specialized migration guidance in the root CLAUDE.md loads it for every review, including changes unrelated to migrations. This increases irrelevant context and can contribute to noisier review feedback rather than targeted convention application.
Copy identical CLAUDE.md files into every current migration directory and update them whenever packages are reorganized.
Explanation
Duplicating directory-level guidance creates drift and requires ongoing maintenance whenever packages move or new migration locations are added. It also ties conventions to current folder placement instead of the file patterns that actually define when the rules apply.
Add a /review-migrations command and require the CI job to invoke it only when migration files change.
Explanation
A custom command can encode a workflow, but it does not solve automatic conditional convention loading within Claude Code’s rule system. This adds brittle external routing logic when the desired behavior is file-pattern-based guidance selection.
Overall explanation
Path-scoped rules are the right fit when a convention applies to files that share naming or location patterns but are spread across multiple directories. A rule file in .claude/rules/ with YAML paths glob patterns lets Claude Code load the migration conventions only when matching files are in scope.

The underlying principle is to attach guidance to the condition that makes it relevant, not to one current folder location. This is especially useful in CI, where unrelated pull requests should not inherit migration-specific review rules that can create noise or false positives.

Duplicating CLAUDE.md files across directories is a maintenance anti-pattern because copies drift and new folders are easy to miss. Placing all specialized guidance in the root CLAUDE.md is also suboptimal because it loads irrelevant context globally. A custom slash command can help with explicit workflows, but it is not the best mechanism for automatic convention loading based on changed file paths.

Question 44
Skipped
Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. A nightly CI review job for large pull requests first asks Claude Code to map ownership boundaries, trace affected call paths, and inspect related tests before producing review findings. On broad changes, the job often fills the conversation with verbose search results and file excerpts, then the final review misses earlier discoveries or gives shallow comments. What adjustment would best preserve review quality while still allowing necessary investigation?
Limit CI review to changed diff hunks only, avoiding exploratory reads so Claude spends attention on final comments.
Explanation
This reduces context usage, but it removes important cross-file and dependency context that large pull requests often require. It can increase false negatives because the model may miss issues that only appear when tracing interactions beyond the diff.
Keep all repository discovery in the main CI session, relying on /compact whenever verbose outputs crowd the conversation.
Explanation
Compaction can help during extended sessions, but it is a reactive cleanup step rather than a design for isolating verbose investigation. It also risks losing details that were never extracted into concise, structured findings before the final review.
Correct answer
Run verbose repository discovery in an Explore subagent, returning concise findings before the main CI review produces structured comments.
Explanation
This isolates the noisy discovery phase from the main review context while still preserving the important conclusions. The main review can then focus on applying judgment and producing actionable findings instead of carrying every intermediate search result and file excerpt.
Paste complete grep outputs and dependency trees into the initial prompt so Claude has maximum codebase context.
Explanation
Maximizing raw context is an anti-pattern for large reviews because attention quality degrades when verbose, low-signal outputs dominate the conversation. More context is not automatically better; the useful facts should be extracted and summarized for the final review pass.
Overall explanation
Using an Explore subagent is the best fit when a workflow requires broad, verbose discovery before a focused final decision. The discovery subagent can inspect files, trace dependencies, and search broadly, then return a concise summary of relevant findings to the main Claude Code session.

The underlying principle is context isolation: keep noisy intermediate investigation separate from the context used for final review judgment. This helps avoid context window pressure, attention dilution, and missed findings caused by accumulated raw tool output.

Relying on /compact after the main session is already crowded is less reliable because it treats context overload after it happens. Reviewing only diff hunks avoids overload, but sacrifices architectural and cross-file understanding. Pasting complete raw outputs creates the same overload problem in a different form and is a common anti-pattern.

Question 57
Skipped
Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. A pull request review workflow launches `claude "Review the changed files for security regressions"` from a CI step. The process starts successfully, but the job sits idle until the CI timeout because the command is waiting for an interactive session instead of returning review text to stdout. What change should you make first?
Move the review command into a background terminal session so CI logs continue while Claude Code remains active.
Explanation
Backgrounding the process hides the blocking behavior instead of producing a completed review result for the pipeline. CI needs a deterministic command that returns output and an exit status, not a long-lived interactive session.
Wrap the existing command in a shell timeout and rerun the CI job whenever no output appears promptly.
Explanation
A timeout treats the symptom rather than changing Claude Code into the correct execution mode. It can create flaky pipelines because the command may still be waiting for interaction when the timeout kills it.
Correct answer
Run Claude Code with `claude -p "Review the changed files for security regressions"` so it prints output and exits.
Explanation
The `-p` or `--print` flag is the documented way to run Claude Code in non-interactive mode for automation. It causes Claude Code to process the prompt, write the response to standard output, and exit instead of opening an interactive session.
Pipe the prompt into the existing `claude` command and rely on end-of-file to close the interactive session.
Explanation
Relying on standard input behavior is not the documented CI integration pattern for Claude Code. The pipeline needs an explicit non-interactive invocation, not an implicit assumption that end-of-file will produce the desired stdout behavior.
Overall explanation
Correct CI invocation: Claude Code should be run with -p or --print when used from automated pipelines. This mode is designed to accept a prompt, emit the result to stdout, and exit without waiting for interactive input.

The underlying principle is that CI jobs require deterministic non-interactive execution. Commands should complete predictably, return output that the pipeline can capture, and avoid hidden prompts that wait for a human operator.

Shell timeouts, stdin tricks, and background terminal sessions are anti-patterns because they work around the hang rather than selecting the correct Claude Code mode. They can produce flaky jobs, missing review output, or orphaned processes that are hard to debug.

Question 6
Skipped
Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. Your CI review uses tool_use to produce a JSON finding object with required fields file_path, start_line, severity, owner_team, linked_ticket, and suggested_fix. In PRs that lack ownership or ticket metadata, reviews contain plausible but nonexistent owner teams and tickets, which downstream automation routes incorrectly. What schema change best addresses this while preserving useful findings?
Keep all fields required and add stronger prompt wording telling Claude never to invent values from context.
Explanation
Stronger wording does not remove the schema pressure to populate fields that may be absent from the source. When a field is required, the model may still produce plausible values to satisfy the schema, especially when downstream parsing expects every field.
Infer absent metadata from repository naming conventions so every finding contains complete routing information for automation.
Explanation
Inferring missing metadata from naming conventions is an anti-pattern because it converts weak assumptions into structured facts. This can route comments or tickets incorrectly and makes the output appear more certain than the evidence supports.
Correct answer
Redesign the schema so unavailable source-dependent fields are nullable or optional, with instructions to return null unless directly evidenced.
Explanation
This addresses the root cause by allowing the structured output to represent absence of evidence without forcing fabricated values. The model can still return valid findings while leaving fields like owner_team or linked_ticket empty when the PR does not provide that information.
Reject any finding missing routing metadata before posting comments, ensuring only fully populated findings reach developers.
Explanation
Rejecting otherwise valid findings loses useful review signal simply because unrelated routing metadata is unavailable. The better design is to preserve the finding while explicitly representing missing source-dependent fields rather than discarding the entire result.
Overall explanation
Nullable or optional fields are the right schema design when source documents, diffs, or CI context may not contain every desired value. Tool use with JSON schemas can enforce syntactically valid structured output, but the schema should not force Claude to invent values for fields like owner_team or linked_ticket when the PR does not provide them.

The underlying principle is to distinguish required facts needed for a valid finding from source-dependent metadata that may be absent. Required fields are appropriate for core review data such as file_path, severity, and suggested_fix when those are necessary to act on the finding. Optional or nullable fields let downstream automation handle missing information explicitly.

Keeping all fields required and relying on stronger prompt wording creates pressure to fabricate. Inferring metadata from repository naming conventions is also unsafe because it turns heuristics into apparently authoritative structured data. Rejecting findings that lack routing metadata reduces false routes, but it also suppresses valid code review issues that developers still need to see.

Question 9
Skipped
Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. After changing the pull request review prompt from "find all potential reliability issues" to "be conservative and include only actionable comments," the bot still flags defensive null checks as bugs and ordinary retry loops as performance defects. Developers dismiss more than half of its comments and say they cannot predict what the bot considers worth reporting. What change should you make next?
Post all findings as non-blocking informational comments so developers can ignore false positives without changing review criteria.
Explanation
Making comments non-blocking reduces immediate workflow friction but does not improve precision. Developers still receive noisy feedback, which can erode trust in accurate findings over time.
Require every finding to include a self-reported confidence score, then suppress comments below a configured confidence threshold.
Explanation
Self-reported confidence is not a reliable proxy for correctness or developer value. The bot may remain confidently wrong on ambiguous code patterns if the prompt still lacks clear reporting criteria.
Add stronger wording that Claude must be extremely conservative and should only comment when it feels completely certain.
Explanation
This repeats the same weak pattern that already failed: relying on vague caution language. Terms like extremely conservative and completely certain do not tell the model which code patterns are reportable versus acceptable.
Correct answer
Replace broad caution language with concrete report and skip criteria for each review category, including representative true-positive and non-issue examples.
Explanation
General caution language does not define the actual decision boundary for what should be reported. Concrete category-specific criteria and examples make the review behavior more predictable and reduce false positives in the areas developers are dismissing.
Overall explanation
Broad caution instructions are not enough. Phrases like be conservative or only include actionable comments sound useful, but they do not define the boundary between a valid finding and an acceptable pattern. A stronger prompt should specify what to report and what to skip for each review category, with examples showing true positives and common non-issues.

The underlying principle is that review prompts need operational criteria, not subjective intensity words. If defensive null checks are being flagged as bugs and ordinary retry loops as performance defects, the prompt should define when those patterns are actually problematic, such as unreachable logic, swallowed errors, unbounded retries, or incorrect fallback behavior.

Increasing vague wording, filtering by self-reported confidence, or making all findings informational are anti-patterns because they do not fix the model's decision boundary. They may reduce perceived urgency, but they leave developers with noisy comments and inconsistent judgments. For more guidance on prompt specificity and examples, see Prompt Engineering.

Question 15
Skipped
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Your extraction tool captures payment_method using a JSON Schema enum of credit_card, ach, wire, and check. In validation logs, documents with wording like "paid through marketplace balance" or no stated payment method either fail enum validation or get coerced into one of the existing categories, which misleads downstream reporting. What schema change best handles these edge cases while preserving structured categories?
Correct answer
Extend the enum with unclear and other, plus a required detail field when other is selected.
Explanation
This preserves structured categories while giving the model valid outputs for ambiguous or novel cases. The unclear value handles missing or ambiguous source evidence, while other plus a detail field captures new categories without forcing an inaccurate existing label.
Replace the enum with an unrestricted string so novel payment descriptions pass validation without schema changes.
Explanation
An unrestricted string reduces validation failures but removes the normalization benefits that downstream systems expect from structured categories. It also makes aggregation and quality checks harder because equivalent values can be expressed many different ways.
Reject any document containing unfamiliar payment wording and route it directly to human review before extraction.
Explanation
Human review is appropriate for some high-risk ambiguous cases, but rejecting every unfamiliar wording is unnecessarily broad. The schema can represent uncertainty and extensible categories directly, allowing downstream workflows to decide which records need review.
Force Claude to choose the closest existing enum value and add a confidence score for downstream filtering.
Explanation
Forcing the closest category creates misleading structured data when the source does not support any existing enum value. A confidence score may help review routing, but it does not fix the schema design problem or prevent inaccurate categorization.
Overall explanation
Schema design should represent real source uncertainty. When a field has known categories but source documents may contain missing, ambiguous, or novel values, the schema should not force the model into inaccurate labels. Adding unclear supports cases where the document does not provide enough evidence, while other plus a detail field preserves the original meaning for categories not yet modeled.

The tradeoff is structure versus flexibility. A closed enum gives downstream systems consistent categories, but it needs safe escape hatches for production data variety. A fully unrestricted string is flexible but weakens validation, aggregation, and quality monitoring.

Anti-patterns fail in different ways. Forcing the nearest enum value creates false precision and can corrupt analytics. Sending all unfamiliar wording to human review wastes reviewer capacity when the extraction can preserve uncertainty structurally. Confidence scores can complement review routing, but they are not a substitute for a schema that admits ambiguous and extensible cases.

Question 22
Skipped
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Your extractor processes vendor contracts and outputs schema-valid records, but downstream reviewers report that obligation summaries vary from terse fragments to long paraphrases, evidence snippets sometimes include irrelevant surrounding text, and action_owner wording is inconsistent. The prompt already contains detailed field definitions and length guidance, but changes have not stabilized outputs. What should you do next?
Set temperature to zero and rely on deterministic decoding to standardize all reviewer-facing extraction wording across documents.
Explanation
Lower temperature can reduce randomness, but it does not define what the correct output style should be. Deterministic decoding may consistently reproduce an undesirable pattern when the model has not been shown the expected format for varied source language.
Expand the field descriptions with stricter prose rules for every obligation type, then ask Claude to be more consistent.
Explanation
The prompt already contains detailed field definitions and length guidance, so adding more prose is unlikely to solve the formatting drift. Vague consistency instructions are weaker than concrete demonstrations of the desired transformation and can add token overhead without clarifying edge cases.
Reject any record whose summaries exceed a fixed word limit, then rerun the full document automatically.
Explanation
A fixed word limit catches only one surface symptom and does not teach the model how to choose evidence boundaries or owner wording. Automatically rerunning the full document without targeted guidance can repeat the same errors and may discard valid obligations that require slightly longer summaries.
Correct answer
Add 2 to 4 representative input and ideal output examples showing concise obligations, evidence boundaries, and owner wording.
Explanation
Few-shot examples are the strongest next step when detailed instructions alone produce inconsistent formatting and actionability. Representative input and ideal output pairs demonstrate exactly how ambiguous source text should be transformed, helping Claude generalize the desired pattern across new contracts.
Overall explanation
Few-shot prompting is most effective when the issue is inconsistent formatting, actionability, or judgment despite detailed written instructions. Concrete input and ideal output examples show the model how to transform messy contract language into concise obligations, bounded evidence snippets, and consistent owner labels.

The key principle is that examples communicate behavioral patterns better than additional prose when outputs depend on judgment. In extraction workflows, schemas can enforce field presence and types, but examples help stabilize the content placed inside those fields.

Adding stricter prose repeats an approach that has already failed, fixed word limits treat symptoms without teaching the extraction behavior, and temperature changes cannot substitute for clear demonstrations. The best practice is to include a small set of targeted examples covering common ambiguity patterns rather than a large generic example bank.

Question 24
Skipped
Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. Your automated PR review has started posting comments that claim error-path tests are missing. Manual spot checks show many flagged cases are already covered through table-driven tests, shared fixtures, or helper-generated cases, but some genuinely uncovered branches still need comments. What change would most effectively improve the review prompt?
Tell Claude to report only high-confidence missing-test findings and suppress anything that might already be covered indirectly.
Explanation
Vague confidence instructions do not teach Claude how to recognize coverage in table-driven tests, fixtures, or helper-generated cases. This may reduce some comments, but it also risks suppressing genuine gaps without addressing the underlying ambiguity.
Require CI to flag gaps only when changed files lack a same-directory test file with matching filename patterns.
Explanation
Filename heuristics are brittle because many legitimate test suites use centralized fixtures, integration tests, or generated test cases in different locations. This approach replaces semantic review with pattern matching and can both miss real gaps and create false positives.
Add a fixed minimum test-count rule per changed file and comment whenever the threshold is not met.
Explanation
A fixed test-count threshold is an anti-pattern because test adequacy depends on behavior, branches, and risk, not raw test counts. It would encourage noisy comments on well-tested small changes and overlook poorly tested complex changes that happen to meet the count.
Correct answer
Add targeted examples showing varied existing test structures and genuine gaps, including why each should be reported or skipped.
Explanation
Targeted examples teach Claude how to interpret ambiguous coverage evidence across different test organization patterns. Showing both acceptable existing coverage and real gaps helps the model generalize judgment instead of assuming unfamiliar test structures are missing tests.
Overall explanation
Few-shot prompting is especially useful when Claude must apply judgment to ambiguous review situations, such as determining whether a branch is already covered by table-driven tests, shared fixtures, or helper-generated cases. Concrete examples can show what evidence counts as existing coverage, what evidence is insufficient, and how to explain a finding when a real gap exists.

The key principle is that examples help Claude generalize judgment to novel patterns, rather than relying only on literal instructions or brittle keyword matches. Including both positive and negative cases is important because the review must avoid false positives while still catching genuine missing tests.

Confidence-only wording is too vague to resolve the ambiguity, and filename or count-based rules are heuristic anti-patterns that ignore how real test suites are organized. For CI review prompts, the better tradeoff is to encode nuanced examples that demonstrate the desired review behavior without hard-coding simplistic rules.

Question 31
Skipped
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Production evaluation shows your extraction tool validates successfully, but downstream analytics are unreliable. New vendor industries and uncertain contract classifications are being squeezed into the closest allowed enum value, causing misleading dashboards even though no JSON schema errors occur. What schema change would best improve reliability while preserving machine-readable output?
Keep the closed enum unchanged and retry extractions until the model selects one of the approved category values.
Explanation
Retries may produce schema-valid output, but they do not solve the semantic problem when the source category is genuinely unclear or outside the enum. This anti-pattern pressures the model to choose an incorrect approved value, making dashboards look cleaner while reducing truthfulness.
Correct answer
Add explicit fallback enum values with companion detail fields so uncertain or novel categories are captured without forced misclassification.
Explanation
This preserves schema validity while giving Claude a safe place to represent uncertainty and categories not anticipated by the original enum. It improves downstream reliability because analytics can separate known categories from uncertain or newly described values instead of treating guesses as facts.
Expand the enum with every observed category and reject documents whose categories are not already listed.
Explanation
Expanding the enum can help for known categories, but it does not handle future unseen categories or genuinely uncertain source evidence. Rejecting otherwise processable documents reduces coverage and creates operational brittleness for evolving document sets.
Replace the enum with a free-text string field and let downstream systems normalize categories after extraction.
Explanation
A free-text field avoids forced enum choices, but it sacrifices the machine-readable consistency that downstream systems need. It pushes classification ambiguity into later systems and can create spelling, synonym, and normalization drift across documents.
Overall explanation
Schema design should represent uncertainty explicitly. When source documents contain categories that are unclear or outside the current taxonomy, the extraction schema needs safe structured ways to capture that reality rather than forcing the closest valid enum value.

The practical pattern is to keep useful enum constraints for known categories while adding fallback values such as unclear or other, paired with detail fields like category_detail or uncertainty_reason. This maintains machine-readable output while preventing semantic misclassification from being hidden behind schema-valid JSON.

Retrying until an approved enum appears is an anti-pattern because it optimizes for validation success instead of extraction truthfulness. Replacing enums with free text loses consistency, while endlessly expanding closed enums still fails on future or genuinely ambiguous cases.

The underlying principle is that JSON schema enforcement guarantees structure, not meaning. Robust extraction systems design schemas that give the model valid ways to say what the evidence supports, including uncertainty and extensible categories. Learn more in Tool Use and Prompt Engineering.

Question 35
Skipped
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. A release candidate updates 18 extraction assets, including prompts, JSON schemas, validators, and few-shot examples across invoices, contracts, and intake forms. A single review request produces uneven results: detailed feedback on early files, superficial comments on later files, and missed mismatches between schema fields and validator assumptions. What review architecture should you use before approving the release?
Ask contributors to limit extraction pull requests to five changed files, postponing larger schema updates until later releases.
Explanation
Reducing pull request size can be helpful as a team practice, but it does not solve the review architecture problem for legitimate multi-file releases. It also imposes an arbitrary cap that can fragment related schema, prompt, and validator changes across releases.
Run three full-repository reviews and report only defects that at least two reviews identify independently.
Explanation
Repeating broad reviews can still suffer from the same attention dilution, and majority voting can suppress real defects that only one pass catches. This is an anti-pattern when the issue is insufficiently focused review scope.
Correct answer
Review each changed file separately for local prompt and schema defects, then run a final pass checking cross-file consistency.
Explanation
Focused per-file review reduces attention dilution by letting Claude evaluate each prompt, schema, validator, or example set in depth. A separate integration pass then examines relationships across files, such as schema fields matching validators and examples reflecting the expected extraction contract.
Increase the context budget and review all changed prompts, schemas, validators, and examples together in one request.
Explanation
A larger context budget may allow more content to fit, but it does not guarantee even attention across every file. The observed failures are attention and review-focus problems, not simply input-size problems.
Overall explanation
Focused review passes work because they allocate Claude's attention to one artifact at a time, improving the depth and consistency of local findings for prompts, schemas, validators, and few-shot examples.

The separate integration pass addresses a different class of risk: relationships across files, such as whether validators enforce the same constraints that schemas expose, whether examples match the intended output format, and whether prompt instructions conflict across document types.

The underlying architectural principle is that large reviews should be decomposed by concern. More context is not the same as better attention, and repeated broad reviews can reproduce the same blind spots while adding cost and latency.

Arbitrary file limits can fragment related changes, while majority voting across full reviews can hide subtle but valid findings. For further study, see Prompt Engineering and Claude Code Overview.

Question 48
Skipped
Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. A pilot of your pull request reviewer shows developers dismiss most performance findings. The current review prompt says: "Only report actionable issues you are highly confident about. Be conservative and avoid nitpicks." The dismissed findings are usually speculative comments like "this loop might be slow" without evidence about input size, hot paths, or repeated work. What prompt change would most effectively improve review precision?
Repeat "be conservative" and "avoid speculation" in the system prompt header, review checklist, and final output instructions.
Explanation
Repeating general instructions increases prompt emphasis but does not clarify the decision boundary. The original prompt already contains similar wording, and the observed failures show that vague caution is not enough to reduce false positives.
Correct answer
Define reportable evidence thresholds for performance findings, including unbounded input growth, hot paths, or repeated database calls inside loops.
Explanation
This replaces vague cautionary wording with concrete conditions that determine whether a performance issue should be reported. It gives Claude observable evidence requirements, which improves precision by filtering out speculative findings before they reach developers.
Require Claude to include longer reasoning for every performance concern, then post findings whose explanations sound specific and cautious.
Explanation
Longer explanations can make weak findings appear more persuasive without making them more valid. Judging whether reasoning sounds cautious is an unreliable natural language filter compared with explicit reportability criteria.
Raise the required self-reported confidence score to 9/10 and automatically suppress any performance finding below that threshold.
Explanation
Self-reported confidence is not a reliable proxy for correctness or actionability. The model may still be confidently wrong, and numeric thresholds do not teach it which evidence makes a performance finding worth reporting.
Overall explanation
Explicit criteria improve precision because they tell Claude what observable evidence must exist before a finding should be reported. In this case, performance findings should be tied to concrete signals such as unbounded input growth, hot execution paths, repeated database calls, or other conditions the team agrees are actionable.

General instructions like be conservative or only report high-confidence findings often fail because they do not define the boundary between a real issue and a speculative concern. Raising a self-reported confidence threshold has the same weakness: confidence is not reliably calibrated and does not replace task-specific evidence requirements.

Repeating vague instructions or selecting findings based on explanations that merely sound careful are anti-patterns for CI review workflows. These approaches can preserve or even amplify false positives because they reward style rather than correctness.

The underlying principle is to encode review judgment as concrete, category-specific reporting rules that match what developers consider actionable. Learn more about prompt specificity and examples in Prompt Engineering and about Claude Code workflows in Claude Code Overview.

Question 50
Skipped
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. In pilot runs, quantity fields from several vendors use shorthand like "approx. 12 kg", "12kg net", and "12 kilograms". The extractor often flags valid variants as defects while accepting truly ambiguous entries like "12 units" without unit context. The schema and validation logic are stable, and prose instructions listing allowed unit formats have not improved consistency. What change would most effectively improve judgment across new vendor layouts?
Correct answer
Add a small set of labeled examples showing acceptable unit variants and genuinely ambiguous entries, including expected fields and reasoning.
Explanation
Few-shot examples are effective when the model must distinguish acceptable patterns from true issues rather than merely follow a format. Showing both positive and negative cases helps Claude generalize judgment to new vendor layouts while reducing false positives on valid variants.
Increase the minimum confidence threshold so borderline extractions are routed to human review before downstream validation occurs.
Explanation
Confidence thresholds can help route uncertain cases, but they do not teach the model the distinction it is currently missing. This would likely increase review volume without reducing the underlying misclassification of valid and ambiguous quantity formats.
Instruct the model to return null for any measurement containing informal wording, unusual spacing, or missing punctuation.
Explanation
This is an overly broad anti-pattern that sacrifices recall by treating many valid source formats as missing data. It would reduce some ambiguous extractions but worsen false negatives for common real-world document variations such as informal abbreviations or compact spacing.
Expand the prompt with a comprehensive list of every vendor-specific unit spelling and abbreviation observed so far.
Explanation
An exhaustive list is brittle because new vendors will continue to introduce unseen phrasing and spacing variations. It encourages memorization of known strings rather than teaching the model the underlying distinction between valid variants and ambiguous measurements.
Overall explanation
Few-shot prompting is the best fit when the failure is inconsistent judgment across ambiguous cases, not JSON syntax or schema enforcement. A compact set of labeled examples can show Claude that 12kg net and 12 kilograms should map to the same normalized quantity, while 12 units may require an ambiguity marker or null unit field depending on the schema.

The underlying principle is that examples help define the decision boundary between acceptable source variation and genuine extraction uncertainty. This is more robust than listing every observed spelling because the model can generalize the pattern to new layouts and vendors.

Raising confidence thresholds only changes downstream routing, not the extraction behavior itself. Returning null for broad categories of informal wording is an anti-pattern because real documents frequently contain shorthand, irregular spacing, and informal notation that still convey valid information.

Question 54
Skipped
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Your extractor captures <code>sample_size</code>, <code>study_design</code>, and <code>citation_source</code> from journal articles. It works on papers with explicit Methods and References sections, but misses the same fields when sample details appear in an abstract footnote, study design appears in an appendix table, or citations are inline only. Validation passes because those fields are nullable, but downstream analytics show systematic under-extraction. What change would most effectively improve extraction quality?
Make sample_size, study_design, and citation_source required in the schema so validation failures force complete outputs.
Explanation
Making fields required creates pressure to fill values even when the source is ambiguous or truly missing. This may reduce nulls superficially, but it increases hallucinated or misplaced values and does not teach better extraction from varied layouts.
Correct answer
Add targeted examples showing correct extraction from multiple document layouts, including inline citations, appendix tables, and embedded methodology details.
Explanation
Targeted examples teach Claude how the same semantic fields can appear in different document structures. This directly addresses systematic under-extraction without pressuring the model to fabricate values when fields are genuinely absent.
Preprocess documents with keyword rules that discard content outside Methods, Results, References, and Appendix headings before extraction.
Explanation
Keyword-based filtering is brittle because the problem involves relevant evidence appearing in unexpected locations. Discarding content before extraction can remove the exact footnotes, inline citations, or embedded details needed for accurate output.
Expand the instructions with a longer list of possible section names and tell Claude to search them exhaustively.
Explanation
Longer prose instructions can help, but they are less effective than concrete examples for demonstrating how to handle structurally varied cases. Section-name lists also fail when relevant information appears outside predictable headings, such as footnotes or embedded tables.
Overall explanation
Few-shot prompting is most useful when the model needs to generalize judgment across varied document structures, not merely follow a format. Examples showing correct extraction from inline citations, appendix tables, abstract footnotes, and embedded methodology details demonstrate how to map differently placed evidence into the same schema fields.

The underlying principle is that concrete input and output examples communicate the desired transformation more reliably than long prose lists of possible headings. They reduce false nulls while preserving the value of nullable schema fields for information that is genuinely absent.

Making fields required is an anti-pattern for extraction systems because it can reward fabricated values. Keyword preprocessing is also risky because it discards evidence based on brittle assumptions about where information should appear. Longer instructions may help at the margins, but they do not demonstrate the ambiguous cases Claude needs to learn.

Question 59

Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. Your automated PR reviewer emits structured findings with fields for file, line, severity, category, and suggested fix. Developers dismiss 38% of comments, but the dashboard only shows broad categories like "bug" and "maintainability," making prompt iteration unfocused. What schema and workflow change would best support systematic improvement?
Parse developer dismissal comments for negative sentiment, then prioritize prompt changes for the most frustrated responses.
Explanation
Sentiment analysis is an anti-pattern for diagnosing review quality because frustration does not reliably identify the underlying failure mode. It can overprioritize emotionally worded responses while missing systematic false positives with neutral dismissals.
Combine dismissed findings into weekly natural-language summaries, then ask Claude to infer the recurring root causes.
Explanation
Natural-language summaries can help with qualitative review, but they discard structured signals needed for reliable trend analysis. Asking Claude to infer root causes after the fact is less dependable than collecting explicit metadata at finding time.
Require Claude to include a higher self-reported confidence score, then suppress comments below the team's chosen threshold.
Explanation
Self-reported confidence is not a reliable proxy for actual finding quality or false-positive risk. It also does not explain which code patterns are causing dismissals, so prompt improvements remain poorly targeted.
Correct answer
Add a structured field capturing the triggering code pattern, then analyze dismissal rates by that field during prompt iterations.
Explanation
Capturing the specific code construct or pattern that triggered each finding makes false-positive analysis actionable. Aggregating dismissals by this field helps identify whether particular patterns, such as wrapper functions or test fixtures, need refined criteria or examples.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: A review feedback loop becomes much more actionable when each structured finding includes a machine-analyzable field such as detected_pattern. Instead of only knowing that many maintainability findings were dismissed, the team can see whether dismissals cluster around specific constructs, such as generated files, dependency injection wrappers, test helper factories, or defensive null checks.

Underlying principle: Validation and feedback loops should preserve diagnostic metadata at the point of generation. This enables systematic prompt iteration, targeted few-shot examples, category refinement, or temporary suppression of specific low-value patterns without weakening accurate findings in other areas.

Why the alternatives fail: Self-reported confidence thresholds are often poorly calibrated and do not identify the cause of false positives. Sentiment-based prioritization is an anti-pattern because emotion is not the same as error type. Retrospective natural-language summaries may be useful for human review, but they are weaker than structured metadata for measuring dismissal patterns over time.

Question 60
Skipped
Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. A structured CI review step extracts findings from pull request diffs into fields including <code>changed_file</code>, <code>changed_line</code>, <code>breaking_change_evidence</code>, and <code>suggested_fix</code>. Validation rejects several potential API-breaking findings because <code>breaking_change_evidence</code> is null. The rejected cases only include generated client changes in the CI context, while the previous API contract and baseline generated files are unavailable. What change best improves extraction quality without increasing unsupported findings?
Correct answer
Classify missing-baseline failures separately, retry only format or placement errors, and add the baseline artifact before re-extracting.
Explanation
Retries are useful when the model has the needed information but produced it in the wrong structure or format. When the evidence is absent from the provided context, the correct recovery is to supply the missing source material or classify the case as unresolved rather than asking the model to invent evidence.
Accept the highest-confidence findings despite missing evidence, then rely on developers to dismiss unsupported CI comments.
Explanation
Self-reported confidence is not a reliable substitute for source evidence or validation. Posting unsupported findings shifts quality control to developers and increases the false-positive burden that the CI workflow is supposed to reduce.
Retry every rejected finding with stronger instructions to fill all required evidence fields before CI posts comments.
Explanation
This treats all validation failures as recoverable, which is unsafe when the required evidence is not present. Stronger instructions can pressure the model to fabricate evidence, increasing false positives and reducing developer trust in CI comments.
Make evidence fields required and ask Claude to infer baseline behavior from generated filenames and changed imports.
Explanation
Making fields required does not create missing source evidence. Asking Claude to infer baseline behavior from indirect signals is an anti-pattern because it substitutes speculation for provenance-backed extraction.
Overall explanation
Correct recovery depends on failure type. Validation retries work well for recoverable problems such as malformed structure, wrong field placement, or normalization mistakes, because the necessary information is already present and the model can correct its output.

When the needed source evidence is absent from the CI context, retrying the same extraction is ineffective. The better pattern is to classify the failure as missing context, provide the missing baseline artifact or prior generated files, then re-run extraction only when the evidence is available.

Anti-patterns include forcing required evidence fields, relying on inferred behavior from filenames, or accepting high-confidence findings without provenance. These approaches increase hallucinated or unsupported review comments and damage developer trust.

The underlying principle is to distinguish semantic validation failures that can be corrected from coverage gaps that require more input. Learn more about structured prompting and validation-oriented workflows in Prompt Engineering and schema-based structured output in Tool Use.

Question 3

Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. Your team uses the system to investigate an unfamiliar legacy repository that powers citation extraction. After several hours, the coordinator starts answering follow-up questions with generic claims about "typical pipeline patterns" and contradicts earlier discoveries about specific classes and data flows. The earlier discoveries were recorded only in long conversation turns mixed with verbose Read, Grep, and test outputs. What change would most effectively preserve accurate findings for later questions?
Add a final synthesis subagent that summarizes the entire conversation only after answers begin becoming inconsistent.
Explanation
Waiting until inconsistency appears is reactive and risks losing important details before they are captured. A one-time summary of the entire conversation can also compress away exact class names, file paths, and data-flow facts.
Correct answer
Have each exploration subagent write key findings to scratchpad files at known paths, and require later prompts to reference them.
Explanation
Scratchpad files create durable state outside the shrinking or noisy conversation context. Requiring later prompts to reference those files helps the coordinator reuse exact prior findings instead of relying on degraded conversational memory.
Increase the coordinator's context budget and retain every verbose tool output in conversation history for later retrieval.
Explanation
A larger context budget delays the problem but does not solve context degradation or attention dilution. Keeping every verbose tool output increases noise and makes important findings harder to retrieve reliably.
Ask the coordinator to answer from memory unless uncertain, then rerun broad repository searches for missing details.
Explanation
Self-assessed uncertainty is not a reliable trigger for recovering missing context. Broad searches also waste time and may produce inconsistent rediscoveries instead of preserving the exact findings already established.
Overall explanation
Durable exploration state is essential during long codebase investigations because conversational context accumulates noisy tool results and eventually degrades. Having agents maintain scratchpad files with specific findings, file paths, class names, dependency relationships, and open questions gives later prompts a stable reference point outside the volatile conversation history.

The underlying principle is to separate working memory from persistent state. Conversation history is useful for immediate coherence, but scratchpad files preserve exact discoveries across long sessions, context compaction, and subagent handoffs.

Simply increasing context or retaining all tool output is an anti-pattern because it increases attention burden and can worsen lost-in-the-middle behavior. Relying on the coordinator's memory or uncertainty estimates is also fragile, while late conversation-wide summarization can omit the exact repository facts needed for accurate follow-up answers.

Question 7

Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. A pipeline extracts insurance policy exclusions from packets containing the policy, riders, emails, and broker notes. The first pass captures detailed snippets, but a middle step condenses each packet into a short narrative before final JSON extraction. Audit reviewers find accurate-looking exclusions in final records, but they cannot determine which document or passage supports each exclusion, especially when riders override earlier policy language. What change best addresses this failure mode?
Ask Claude to include citations only for exclusions it considers uncertain, keeping straightforward final records easier to read.
Explanation
Selective citation based on perceived uncertainty is an anti-pattern for audit workflows because confident-looking claims can still be wrong or unsupported. Provenance should be required for all extracted facts that downstream systems may rely on, not only for fields the model flags as uncertain.
Increase the final synthesis context budget so Claude can reread all original packet documents before producing each JSON record.
Explanation
Providing more context at the final step does not guarantee that each extracted fact remains tied to its supporting passage. It also increases cost and attention burden, and it does not fix the provenance loss caused by the intermediate compression step.
Append a packet-level bibliography to every final JSON record so reviewers can manually search likely source documents.
Explanation
A bibliography shows which documents were processed, but it does not connect individual exclusions to specific passages. Reviewers would still need to manually infer support, and conflicting or overriding language could remain ambiguous.
Correct answer
Change intermediate handoffs so each extracted fact carries its source document, location, and supporting excerpt into final synthesis.
Explanation
This preserves provenance at the same granularity as the extracted information, so downstream systems can trace each final field back to supporting evidence. It directly addresses the failure introduced by compression, where a summary keeps the conclusion but drops the source relationship needed for auditability.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: The pipeline should preserve provenance through every transformation by keeping each extracted fact paired with its source document, location, and supporting excerpt. This prevents the middle summarization step from flattening evidence into unsupported narrative conclusions.

Underlying principle: Source attribution is commonly lost when findings are compressed without preserving claim-source relationships. In structured extraction systems, provenance should be part of the data contract, not a later presentation detail added after synthesis.

A packet-level bibliography is insufficient because it lists possible sources without connecting specific JSON fields to evidence. Simply increasing the final context budget can worsen cost and attention issues while still failing to preserve field-level traceability. Selective citation based on model uncertainty is also unreliable, since confidence is not a substitute for evidence.

For reliable downstream integration, design schemas and handoff formats that carry evidence metadata alongside extracted values, using nullable fields when information is absent rather than fabricating support.

Question 13
Skipped
Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Your pipeline extracts obligations from vendor contracts, policy memos, and meeting notes into a consolidated compliance matrix. Reviewers find that when two sources support the same obligation with slightly different wording, final rows contain a polished obligation statement and a bibliography list, but no row-level evidence trail. Auditors reject several rows because they cannot verify which excerpts were merged into each statement. What should you change?
Store the full input documents alongside the final matrix and instruct auditors to search them when evidence is needed.
Explanation
Keeping source documents is useful for audit storage, but it does not solve row-level traceability. Auditors still need to know which passages support each synthesized statement without redoing the extraction work manually.
Choose the highest-confidence source for each obligation during deduplication and discard lower-confidence supporting excerpts before synthesis.
Explanation
Discarding supporting excerpts is an anti-pattern because it removes corroborating evidence and hides source diversity. Confidence scoring cannot replace provenance, especially when multiple sources jointly support a synthesized claim.
Correct answer
Require each extracted obligation to carry source excerpts and locations, then preserve and merge that evidence into each synthesized matrix row.
Explanation
This preserves provenance at the level where reviewers need it: each synthesized obligation row. When multiple sources support the same obligation, the system can merge the supporting evidence rather than reducing it to an unactionable bibliography.
Add a final verification prompt asking Claude to reconstruct citations for each matrix row after synthesis is complete.
Explanation
Reconstructing citations after synthesis is unreliable because attribution may already have been lost in earlier steps. The model may infer plausible sources rather than preserve the actual evidence used to create each row.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: Multi-source synthesis needs provenance that survives every handoff. Each extracted obligation should include its supporting excerpt, document identifier, and location metadata, and the synthesis step should preserve and merge those evidence records into the final matrix row.

Underlying principle: A final bibliography proves only that documents were consulted, not which passages support each synthesized claim. For downstream validation and audit workflows, attribution must be maintained as structured data rather than recreated from memory after the fact.

Why the alternatives fail: Asking Claude to reconstruct citations after synthesis risks plausible but incorrect attribution. Storing full documents without row-level links pushes verification work onto auditors. Selecting only one high-confidence source discards useful corroboration and can hide uncertainty or source diversity.

Question 26

Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. During load testing, reports on broad topics become inconsistent once the research phase produces more than 30 source analyses. The document analysis subagent completes successfully, but its outputs are long narrative memos with internal reasoning, copied verbatim into the synthesis prompt. The synthesis agent omits high value evidence from earlier analyses and sometimes cites sources that were discussed but not central. What redesign best addresses the reliability problem?
Ask the synthesis agent to summarize each long subagent narrative first, then synthesize from its own summaries.
Explanation
This adds another summarization layer after the context has already become noisy and oversized. Progressive summarization can lose exact facts, citations, and relevance judgments, especially when the original handoff format is verbose and inconsistent.
Correct answer
Modify upstream subagents to return compact structured records: key facts, citations, relevance scores, and only synthesis-relevant details.
Explanation
This addresses the context budget problem at the source by reducing verbose handoff content before it reaches the synthesis agent. Structured records preserve the information the downstream agent needs for report generation while reducing attention dilution and lost-in-the-middle failures.
Truncate each subagent response after a fixed character limit before sending it to the synthesis agent for review.
Explanation
Fixed truncation is an anti-pattern because it may remove the most important evidence, citations, or caveats without understanding content relevance. It reduces tokens, but it does not preserve the facts needed for reliable synthesis.
Increase the synthesis agent's max_tokens and ask it to carefully read every upstream narrative before writing reports.
Explanation
Increasing max_tokens affects how much the model can generate, not whether it can reliably attend to large, noisy inputs. Asking the model to be careful does not remove irrelevant reasoning chains or improve the structure of handoff data.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: When downstream agents have limited context budgets, upstream agents should return structured, synthesis-ready data rather than verbose narratives and internal reasoning chains. Compact records containing key_facts, citations, relevance_scores, and necessary caveats preserve the information needed for downstream reasoning while reducing context pressure.

Underlying principle: Context management is not just about making prompts shorter, it is about preserving the right information in the right shape. In multi-agent systems, the handoff contract between agents determines whether later agents can reliably aggregate findings, maintain attribution, and avoid lost-in-the-middle omissions.

Why the alternatives fail: Increasing max_tokens does not solve noisy input context or attention dilution. Fixed truncation is unsafe because it can discard important evidence arbitrarily. Having the synthesis agent summarize verbose narratives adds another lossy compression step instead of fixing the upstream output format.

Question 27

Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. A long-running audit of your extraction pipeline delegates separate Claude Code subagents to inspect parser modules, schema definitions, validation failures, and downstream mapping logic. Twice this week, the process was interrupted after hours of exploration. When restarted, the coordinator repeated completed investigations, missed several previously discovered edge cases, and gave subagents incomplete background about which document formats had already been analyzed. What design change would most improve reliability after interruptions?
Restart the audit from the beginning whenever an interruption occurs, discarding partial subagent findings to avoid inconsistency.
Explanation
Discarding partial findings avoids stale state, but it wastes hours of completed work and increases the chance of inconsistent coverage between runs. It also fails to preserve discovered edge cases that may be expensive or difficult to rediscover.
Resume the prior named session and ask Claude to infer unfinished work from the accumulated conversation history.
Explanation
Resuming a prior session can help when the context remains valid, but it is not reliable crash recovery for long explorations. The accumulated history may contain stale tool results, verbose intermediate reasoning, and missing context about what changed after interruption.
Correct answer
Have each subagent export structured state to fixed paths, then load a resume manifest into restarted coordinator prompts.
Explanation
This approach preserves the key discoveries, completion status, and handoff context outside the volatile conversation. Loading a manifest on resume lets the coordinator reconstruct work state and inject relevant details into new subagent prompts without relying on stale or incomplete session memory.
Keep a single freeform scratchpad summary updated manually, then tell new subagents to continue from that summary.
Explanation
A freeform scratchpad can help with context degradation, but it is weaker than structured state for crash recovery. Without explicit fields for completed work, unresolved questions, source paths, and ownership, the coordinator cannot reliably resume or delegate work.
Overall explanation
Structured state persistence is the most reliable pattern for recovering from interrupted long-running agent workflows. Each subagent should export machine-readable state, such as completed files, discovered edge cases, unresolved questions, relevant source paths, and partial results, to known locations. On restart, the coordinator loads a resume manifest and injects the relevant state into prompts for any restarted or newly spawned subagents.

The underlying principle is that long conversation context is not a durable system of record. Named session resumption can be useful when prior context is mostly valid, but relying on accumulated history alone risks stale tool results, repeated exploration, and missing handoff details. Starting over wastes completed work, while a single freeform summary lacks the structure needed for reliable coordination and coverage tracking.

For large codebase or pipeline exploration, durable structured state gives the coordinator an external source of truth that survives crashes and context compaction. This complements Claude Code workflows and subagent delegation patterns described in Claude Code Overview and Claude Code Sub-agents.

Question 37
Skipped
Scenario: Multi-Agent Research System You are building a multi-agent research system using the Claude Agent SDK. A coordinator agent delegates to specialized subagents: one searches the web, one analyzes documents, one synthesizes findings, and one generates reports. The system researches topics and produces comprehensive, cited reports. Your report generator receives synthesis notes from a peer-reviewed meta-analysis, two industry surveys, and several vendor benchmarks. In the final report, a vendor benchmark's narrow claim is presented with the same authority as a repeated meta-analysis finding, and readers cannot judge how much weight to give each conclusion. What change would best improve the reliability of the report?
Have the synthesis agent select the most authoritative-looking source for each topic and omit weaker conflicting evidence.
Explanation
This is an anti-pattern because it hides uncertainty and gives readers no visibility into contested areas. The agent may also misjudge authority based on superficial cues, especially across different source types such as surveys, benchmarks, and meta-analyses.
Normalize all findings into one uniform summary style, then place complete citations in a bibliography at the end.
Explanation
A uniform style makes the report easier to read but worsens the core reliability issue by hiding differences in evidence strength. End citations alone do not preserve how each source characterized its own findings or what methodology supports each claim.
Correct answer
Organize conclusions by evidentiary status, retaining source characterization and methodological context for each major claim in the final report.
Explanation
This preserves uncertainty by making the strength and nature of evidence visible to readers. Separating stronger conclusions from disputed or tentative ones prevents the report from flattening source quality into a single authoritative narrative.
Ask the report agent to add a general disclaimer that some sources may vary in quality and methodology.
Explanation
A general disclaimer acknowledges uncertainty but does not attach that uncertainty to specific claims. Readers still cannot distinguish which conclusions are well supported, narrow, preliminary, or contested.
Overall explanation
Preserving uncertainty in synthesis requires more than attaching citations. The final report should distinguish conclusions by evidentiary status, such as well-supported findings, emerging findings, and contested findings, while preserving each source's characterization and methodological context.

This approach works because multi-source synthesis often combines evidence with different weights: peer-reviewed meta-analyses, industry surveys, vendor benchmarks, and expert commentary should not be presented with identical authority. Keeping source type, study scope, methodology, and limitations near the relevant claim helps readers understand how much confidence to place in each conclusion.

Flattening all findings into a uniform style is a common anti-pattern because it improves polish while reducing epistemic transparency. Selecting only the most authoritative-looking source can suppress legitimate disagreement, while broad disclaimers are too generic to help readers evaluate individual claims.

The underlying principle is provenance-aware synthesis: downstream agents must preserve not only citations, but also the context needed to interpret those citations.

Question 52
Skipped
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. The QA process reviews 2% of auto-resolved tickets chosen uniformly each week. The dashboard shows 96% overall correctness, but refunds later reversed by human supervisors are concentrated in rare marketplace-seller warranty claims and older billing disputes that barely appear in the sample. You need to redesign review without sending every automated resolution to humans. What should you do?
Ask the agent to include a single global confidence score, then audit cases closest to the threshold.
Explanation
A single global confidence score can help prioritize review, but it does not reveal whether accuracy differs across case types, product channels, or resolution actions. Auditing only near-threshold cases also misses high-confidence failures in poorly calibrated segments.
Increase the overall random sample from 2% to 5%, keeping selection uniform across all auto-resolved tickets.
Explanation
A larger uniform sample may improve statistical power overall, but it still can miss rare segments when their base rate is very low. The observed failures are concentrated in specific slices, so representation by segment matters more than simply sampling more cases uniformly.
Stop sampling tickets above the confidence threshold, and review only low-confidence or customer-complaint cases going forward.
Explanation
This is an anti-pattern because it assumes high-confidence outputs are safe without ongoing measurement. Customer complaints are a lagging signal, and high-confidence failures are exactly what the QA process needs to detect before customers or supervisors find them.
Correct answer
Use stratified random sampling across issue type, order age, seller channel, and resolution action for high-confidence auto-closures.
Explanation
Stratified random sampling ensures that rare but important segments are represented in the review set, even when overall volume is low. This makes it possible to measure hidden error rates in high-confidence cases and detect new failure patterns before they grow.
Overall explanation
Stratified random sampling is the right design when aggregate accuracy looks strong but errors cluster in rare or operationally important segments. By sampling within slices such as issue type, order age, seller channel, and resolution action, the team can estimate error rates for high-confidence automated outcomes rather than relying on a single blended metric.

The underlying reliability principle is that aggregate accuracy can hide segment-level failures. A support agent can appear safe overall while performing poorly on a small category such as marketplace warranty claims, older billing disputes, or high-value refund decisions.

Increasing a uniform sample helps only if the problematic segments appear often enough, which the scenario shows they do not. Stopping review of high-confidence cases is risky because confidence must be continuously validated, and complaint-driven review detects problems after customer harm has occurred. A single global confidence score is also insufficient because calibration can differ by segment.

Question 53

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. Production review finds the agent routes many frustrated but straightforward damage-replacement cases to escalate_to_human. The tickets usually include phrases like "this is ridiculous" and photos matching your standard replacement policy, but not an explicit request for a human. Which change best improves escalation calibration while preserving customer preference handling?
Automatically escalate any message with angry language before investigating, because negative sentiment indicates the case is too complex.
Explanation
Sentiment-based escalation is an anti-pattern because frustration does not reliably correlate with case complexity. This would reduce first-contact resolution by escalating cases the agent can handle under the standard replacement policy.
Require the agent to finish all available investigation steps before honoring any human escalation preference from the customer.
Explanation
This goes too far in the opposite direction by ignoring explicit customer preferences. If a customer clearly asks for a human, the agent should honor that request rather than forcing an autonomous investigation first.
Correct answer
Update guidance to acknowledge frustration, proceed with supported resolution steps, and escalate only if the customer again asks for a human.
Explanation
Frustration alone is not a reliable signal that a case requires human escalation. When the issue is within the agent's capability and the customer has not explicitly requested a human, the agent should attempt the supported resolution while remaining ready to escalate if the customer states that preference.
Have the agent request a self-rated confidence score from itself, escalating when the score falls below a threshold.
Explanation
Self-reported confidence is poorly calibrated for escalation decisions and can be misleading in ambiguous support cases. Explicit criteria tied to customer preference, policy coverage, and meaningful progress are more reliable than a numeric self-rating.
Overall explanation
Correct escalation calibration separates emotional tone from actual escalation criteria. A frustrated customer with a straightforward, policy-covered issue should receive empathy and a resolution attempt, not an automatic handoff, unless they explicitly request or reiterate a preference for a human.

The underlying tradeoff is between maximizing first-contact resolution and respecting customer agency. The agent should acknowledge the customer's frustration, continue with supported actions like a standard damage replacement, and promptly use escalate_to_human if the customer makes a clear human handoff request.

Automatically escalating based on angry language is a sentiment-based anti-pattern because it treats emotional tone as a proxy for complexity. Forcing the agent to complete all investigation steps before honoring a human request is also incorrect because explicit customer preference is a valid escalation trigger. Self-rated confidence thresholds are unreliable unless calibrated and tied to concrete criteria.

Question 55
Skipped
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. A long-running billing dispute workflow delegates separate investigations for account status, order history, and refund eligibility. The service sometimes restarts after deploying updates. After restart, the coordinator resumes but cannot determine which subagent findings are current, re-runs completed investigations, and occasionally omits evidence needed for escalation handoffs. What design change best improves reliability?
Set a fixed limit of one retry per subagent after restarts, then continue with whichever findings return first.
Explanation
A fixed retry cap is an anti-pattern when used as the main reliability mechanism because it does not preserve completed work or explain missing evidence. Continuing with whichever findings return first risks incomplete resolutions and weak escalation handoffs.
Store only the final customer response draft after each run, using it as the sole recovery checkpoint.
Explanation
A final response draft is not enough to recover investigation state because it usually lacks tool outputs, unresolved questions, source metadata, and subagent completion status. Recovery needs structured intermediate state, not only the last customer-facing message.
Resume the prior coordinator session and ask Claude to reconstruct missing subagent progress from the conversation transcript.
Explanation
Session resumption can help when prior context is still valid, but it is not a reliable crash recovery strategy for isolated subagent work. The coordinator may not have complete subagent context, and reconstructed progress can omit details or treat stale tool results as current.
Correct answer
Have each subagent export structured state to a known location; the coordinator reloads and injects it when resuming.
Explanation
This creates an explicit recovery mechanism that does not depend on fragile conversational memory. Loading structured state on resume lets the coordinator determine what was completed, what remains, and what evidence must be passed into new or resumed subagent prompts.
Overall explanation
Structured state persistence is the right reliability pattern for crash recovery in multi-agent or delegated workflows. Each subagent should export its current findings, attempted actions, tool result references, unresolved questions, and completion status to a known location, then the coordinator should load that state on resume and inject the relevant parts into subsequent prompts.

This works because subagents operate with isolated context and do not automatically share durable memory with the coordinator. Explicit state handoff prevents duplicated investigation, missing evidence, and stale assumptions after a restart.

Relying on session resumption or asking Claude to reconstruct progress from a transcript is fragile, especially when tool results or subagent contexts are incomplete. Fixed retry caps and continuing with partial findings are anti-patterns because they manage control flow without preserving the information needed for correct recovery. Saving only the final customer response also loses provenance and intermediate decisions needed for escalation or refund safety.

For further study, review the Agent SDK documentation and the Claude Code Sub-agents documentation for patterns around delegated work and explicit context passing.
