Description
This course contains the use of artificial intelligence.

Are you preparing for the Claude Certified Architect - Foundations certification? These three full-length practice exams are the most thorough preparation resource available, designed to match the real exam's format, difficulty, and domain coverage as closely as possible.

What makes these practice exams different?

Every question in these exams is scenario-based, just like the real certification. You won't find simple factual recall questions here. Instead, each question places you in a realistic production context and asks you to make the kind of architectural judgment calls that working solution architects face every day: choosing between orchestration patterns, designing tool interfaces, configuring Claude Code workflows, engineering reliable prompts, and managing context windows effectively.

Realistic exam structure and domain distribution:

Each practice exam contains 60 multiple-choice questions with 1 correct answer and 3 plausible distractors

Questions follow the exact domain weightings from the official exam guide: Agentic Architecture & Orchestration (27%), Tool Design & MCP Integration (18%), Claude Code Configuration & Workflows (20%), Prompt Engineering & Structured Output (20%), and Context Management & Reliability (15%)

Each exam randomly selects 4 of 6 scenarios from the exam guide (Customer Support Resolution Agent, Code Generation with Claude Code, Multi-Agent Research System, Developer Productivity with Claude, Claude Code for Continuous Integration, and Structured Data Extraction), matching the real exam's scenario selection process

Incorrect answer choices include realistic anti-patterns that someone with incomplete knowledge might choose, testing your ability to distinguish best practices from common mistakes

Detailed explanations that teach, not just test:

After each question, you'll receive a thorough explanation covering why the correct approach works, why each distractor fails, and the underlying architectural principle at play. Explanations include direct links to official Anthropic documentation so you can dive deeper into any topic where you need more preparation.

Built with quality controls:

Every question was validated against 11 quality criteria, including technical accuracy verification against the official exam guide, answer length parity checks (so the correct answer never stands out), topic scope compliance with the exam guide's in-scope and out-of-scope lists, and verification that no invented features or APIs appear in any answer choice. Questions are also checked for duplication across all three exams to maximize the breadth of topics covered.

These practice exams are an ideal complement to the free preparation courses offered by Anthropic. If you've completed the coursework and want to validate your readiness before sitting for the real certification, these exams will show you exactly where you stand and where to focus your remaining study time.

Question 1

Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. Your CI job invokes Claude Code in non-interactive mode to produce structured PR review findings. The output always passes JSON Schema validation, but your PR-comment step sometimes fails or posts misleading comments: a finding cites line 220 in a 90-line file, uses a file path not present in the diff, or places the vulnerable snippet inside the remediation field. What should you change in the review pipeline?
Correct answer
Keep tool_use schema enforcement, add deterministic checks for line ranges and file membership, then retry with those failures included.
Explanation
The failures are not JSON syntax problems; they are semantic consistency problems in otherwise schema-valid findings. Keeping schema enforcement prevents malformed structured output, while deterministic validators catch impossible or misplaced values and provide actionable feedback for a targeted retry.
Replace tool_use with prompted raw JSON and reject any response containing markdown, explanations, or missing fields.
Explanation
Prompted raw JSON is less reliable than tool use for structured output and reintroduces syntax failure modes that the current pipeline has already solved. Rejecting markdown or missing fields does not address impossible line numbers, invalid file paths, or content placed in the wrong semantic field.
Increase schema strictness by making every field required and using enums for all free-text review fields.
Explanation
More required fields and enums can improve some structural constraints, but they cannot verify cross-field relationships like whether a line exists in a changed file. Overly rigid schemas can also encourage fabricated values when source evidence is unavailable.
Run up to three blind retries whenever inline posting fails, accepting the first schema-valid response.
Explanation
Blind retries are an anti-pattern because they do not tell the model what was wrong or distinguish syntax validity from semantic correctness. Accepting the first schema-valid response repeats the same weakness that allowed impossible line references and misplaced fields through.
Overall explanation
Schema compliance is not the same as semantic correctness. Tool use with JSON schemas is the right foundation because it eliminates malformed structured output, but a schema can still accept a finding that references a nonexistent line, an unchanged file, or values placed in the wrong meaningful field.

The practical pattern is to keep tool_use schema enforcement, then add deterministic validation for business and workflow rules such as changed-file membership, valid line ranges, required source evidence, and field placement. When validation fails, send a follow-up request containing the original context, the failed finding, and the specific validation errors so Claude can correct recoverable mistakes.

Switching back to raw prompted JSON solves the wrong problem and makes syntax reliability worse. Making every field required or enum-constrained cannot validate relationships against the pull request diff, and blind retry loops waste attempts without giving the model corrective signal.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. Pilot logs show that <code>process_refund</code> returns the same short failure text for processor timeouts, expired refund windows, missing staff permissions, and malformed amounts. The agent responds inconsistently: it retries policy denials, escalates simple input mistakes, and gives customers vague explanations when permission is missing. What change would most directly improve the agent's recovery decisions?
Configure the agent to retry every failed tool call three times before escalating unresolved requests to a human.
Explanation
Uniform retries waste time on non-retryable conditions such as expired refund windows, invalid inputs, or missing permissions. This anti-pattern treats all failures as transient, which is exactly why the agent is making poor recovery decisions.
Replace process_refund with separate tools for timeouts, policy denials, permission issues, and invalid input cases.
Explanation
These are possible outcomes of a refund attempt, not separate actions the agent can reliably choose before calling the backend. Splitting tools by unknown failure mode increases tool-selection complexity while still failing to communicate what actually happened after execution.
Add prompt instructions telling the agent to infer failure causes from customer wording and conversation sentiment.
Explanation
Customer wording and sentiment are unreliable proxies for backend failure causes. The agent cannot safely infer whether a refund failed due to timeout, policy, permission, or validation without explicit information from the tool result.
Correct answer
Update each MCP tool to return categorized failures with retryability and customer-safe guidance tailored to the specific backend condition.
Explanation
The agent needs enough machine-readable context to distinguish failures that require retry, clarification, escalation, or customer explanation. Categorized failures with retryability and safe guidance let the agent choose different recovery paths for timeouts, invalid inputs, permission issues, and policy denials.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: MCP tools should return enough structured failure information for the agent to decide what to do next. A timeout may be retryable, a malformed amount may require clarification or correction, a permission issue may require escalation, and an expired refund window may require a customer-friendly policy explanation.

Underlying principle: Generic failure text such as Operation failed hides the distinction between transient, validation, permission, and business-rule errors. Without those distinctions, the model must guess, which leads to wasted retries, unnecessary escalations, and vague customer communication.

Why the alternatives fail: Retrying every failure is an anti-pattern because many failures are not retryable. Inferring backend causes from sentiment or customer wording is unreliable because the real cause exists in system state, not conversational tone. Splitting a refund action into tools named after possible failure modes adds ambiguity because the agent usually cannot know the failure mode until after the refund tool runs.

Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. A CI review job recently added strict accessibility guidance intended only for React UI files. After deployment, Claude starts flagging backend route handlers and migration scripts for missing ARIA labels because the guidance is loaded on every review. You need the guidance to apply automatically only when relevant changed files are in scope. What should you change?
Add a root CLAUDE.md instruction telling Claude to ignore accessibility guidance unless filenames look like React components.
Explanation
This relies on the model to manually infer whether instructions are relevant, so the guidance may still influence unrelated reviews. It also keeps the rule always loaded, which increases irrelevant context and can continue causing false positives.
Correct answer
Move the accessibility guidance into a .claude/rules/ file with YAML frontmatter paths matching React component globs.
Explanation
Path-specific rule files allow Claude Code to load guidance only when file paths match the declared glob patterns. This keeps accessibility conventions available for React UI files while preventing unrelated backend or migration reviews from receiving irrelevant instructions.
Use @import from the project CLAUDE.md and ask Claude to decide whether the imported accessibility file applies.
Explanation
An imported file becomes part of the loaded project context, so it does not conditionally activate based on the changed file path. Asking Claude to decide after loading the guidance is an anti-pattern when path-scoped configuration can prevent irrelevant instructions from entering context.
Create a .claude/commands/accessibility.md command and require CI to invoke it only for pull requests containing UI files.
Explanation
Custom slash commands are useful for explicit workflows, but they do not provide automatic conditional loading of coding conventions by file path. This would add CI routing complexity and still would not solve rule activation inside normal Claude Code context handling.
Overall explanation
Path-specific rules are the right fit when guidance should load only for files matching particular path patterns. In Claude Code, rule files in .claude/rules/ can use YAML frontmatter with a paths field containing glob patterns, such as paths: ["src/**/*.tsx", "components/**/*.tsx"], so conventions activate only for matching files.

The underlying tradeoff is precision versus always-loaded context. Keeping specialized guidance in a root CLAUDE.md or importing it unconditionally can pollute reviews for unrelated files, increasing token usage and false positives. A slash command can support an explicit workflow, but it is not the mechanism for automatic path-based convention loading.

Prompting Claude to infer when rules apply is weaker than configuring the rule scope directly, because the irrelevant instruction has already entered the context. For CI review reliability, the better pattern is to prevent irrelevant conventions from loading in the first place. Learn more in CLAUDE.md Configuration and the Claude Code Overview.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. During testing, the coordinator sends refund-investigation subagents long prompts that prescribe exact tool sequences and conditional branches. These subagents work on standard returns, but they fail or ask for unnecessary escalation when a customer describes unusual evidence, missing order numbers, or mixed billing and delivery concerns. What change would most improve subagent performance while preserving coordinator control?
Expand delegated prompts with more detailed step-by-step branches covering missing order numbers, mixed issues, and unusual evidence types.
Explanation
Adding more procedural branches makes the prompt more brittle and harder for the model to follow across novel cases. It may improve a few known paths, but it does not address the underlying need for adaptive investigation within the subagent's assigned scope.
Require subagents to follow a fixed tool order and escalate whenever any expected intermediate field is unavailable.
Explanation
A fixed tool order is an anti-pattern for ambiguous support cases because missing fields may have recoverable alternatives. Escalating whenever an expected field is unavailable reduces first-contact resolution and prevents the subagent from using available context intelligently.
Have the coordinator parse each subagent's natural-language response for completion phrases before deciding whether to continue.
Explanation
Parsing natural-language completion phrases is an unreliable control-flow mechanism and can break when wording changes. The coordinator should rely on structured outputs and explicit orchestration state rather than fragile text matching.
Correct answer
Rewrite delegated prompts to state the support objective, known context, quality criteria, constraints, and required structured return format.
Explanation
Subagents perform better when they understand the goal, relevant context, constraints, and success criteria rather than following brittle procedural scripts. This preserves coordinator control over delegation and output shape while allowing the subagent to adapt its tool use to unusual customer details.
Overall explanation
Goal-oriented delegation gives subagents enough direction to solve the assigned problem without locking them into brittle procedures. In practice, the coordinator should provide the objective, known customer and case context, constraints such as refund policy boundaries, quality criteria, and the required structured output format.

The architectural tradeoff is between control and adaptability. The coordinator should retain control over decomposition, routing, and aggregation, while the subagent should have room to choose the appropriate tool path within its scoped role.

Expanding long procedural scripts can appear safer, but it often creates fragile behavior when support cases deviate from expected paths. Fixed tool orders and automatic escalation on missing fields reduce autonomy and can lower first-contact resolution when the missing information could be inferred or requested through another path.

Parsing natural-language phrases for orchestration is also unreliable because wording is not a stable interface. For multi-agent systems, use explicit prompts, structured handoff data, and coordinator-managed orchestration rather than text scraping. Learn more in the Agent SDK and Tool Use documentation.

Scenario: Code Generation with Claude Code You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. A CI review job already runs non-interactively and completes, but the script that posts inline pull request comments frequently fails because Claude's findings vary between markdown bullets, paragraphs, and code fences. Sometimes severity labels are missing or line ranges are formatted differently, so valid findings are dropped or posted to the wrong lines. What change would best make the review results reliable for automated consumption?
Post Claude’s entire text response as one pull request comment and ask developers to review manually.
Explanation
Posting a single unstructured comment avoids parsing failures, but it gives up the requirement for reliable automated inline comments. It also shifts triage work back to developers instead of producing actionable machine-placed findings.
Use the -p flag alone and have the CI script split Claude’s response into sections by heading.
Explanation
The job is already running non-interactively and completing, so the missing capability is not basic pipeline execution. Splitting text by headings remains dependent on natural language formatting and can still fail when headings vary or are omitted.
Correct answer
Run Claude Code with --output-format json and --json-schema defining required fields for each pull request finding.
Explanation
Using structured JSON output with an explicit schema gives the CI script a stable contract for parsing findings. This directly addresses malformed or inconsistent review output while still allowing Claude to generate substantive review content.
Keep markdown output but add stricter prompt wording and regex patterns for severity, filename, and line extraction.
Explanation
Parsing free-form markdown with regular expressions is brittle because small wording or formatting variations can break downstream automation. Stricter prompt wording may reduce variation, but it does not provide the same machine-parseable contract as schema-enforced output.
Overall explanation
Structured CI output should use Claude Code's JSON output support with a JSON schema, so downstream automation receives predictable fields such as file path, line range, severity, summary, and suggested fix. This creates a stable contract between Claude Code and the CI script that posts inline pull request comments.

The underlying principle is to avoid using free-form natural language as an integration boundary. Prompting Claude to be more consistent can help humans read results, but CI systems need machine-parseable output with explicit fields and validation.

Regex parsing markdown, splitting responses by headings, or posting one large text block are anti-patterns for automated review workflows. They either remain brittle under formatting variation or abandon inline automation entirely.

Scenario: Code Generation with Claude Code You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. Your /migrate-to-new-logger command uses a coordinator that launches subagents to scan packages and propose edits. In a dry run, the final plan says the legacy logger appears only in billing and notifications. Later, reviewers discover the auth package was never scanned because a subagent hit a path permission error, while the search subagent for reporting scanned successfully and found no matches. The coordinator received both results as "no findings." What change would most improve reliability of future migration plans?
Terminate the entire migration workflow whenever any package scan fails, discarding successful findings from other subagents.
Explanation
Stopping the whole workflow on a single localized failure wastes valid findings from packages that were scanned successfully. The coordinator should receive structured context so it can decide whether to retry, proceed with caveats, or ask for human help.
Correct answer
Have subagents report successful empty searches separately from access failures, including attempted paths, queries, partial results, and suggested next steps.
Explanation
This approach preserves the difference between a successful search with no matches and a failed search that produced no usable coverage. It gives the coordinator enough information to retry, reroute, or annotate the migration plan with a coverage gap instead of treating unscanned code as clean.
Treat every subagent result with no code references as successful, then rely on reviewers to catch any missing packages.
Explanation
This silently suppresses access failures by converting them into apparent clean results, which is a reliability anti-pattern. It makes the migration plan look more complete than it is and prevents the coordinator from taking recovery actions.
Ask each subagent to summarize failures in natural language, letting the coordinator infer whether missing findings indicate clean code.
Explanation
Natural language summaries are too ambiguous for reliable recovery decisions, especially when empty results and failures can look similar. The coordinator needs structured status and metadata rather than inferring meaning from prose.
Overall explanation
Correct recovery design: In a multi-agent workflow, subagents should distinguish a valid empty result from an access failure. A successful search with no matches means the package was covered, while a permission or path error means the package remains uninspected.

The coordinator can only make intelligent decisions when it receives structured error context such as failure type, attempted path, attempted query, partial results, and potential alternatives. With that context, it can retry with a different path, delegate to another subagent, continue with explicit coverage annotations, or escalate for human help.

Silently returning empty results as success hides reliability problems and can produce unsafe migration plans. Terminating the entire workflow on one failure is also too brittle because it discards useful work from successful subagents. Natural language failure summaries are less reliable than structured fields because the coordinator must infer whether missing findings mean clean code or missing coverage.

The underlying principle is error propagation with actionable context: local recovery should happen when possible, and unresolved failures should be propagated with enough detail for the coordinator to choose the next step.

Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. Your review job emits structured findings that always pass JSON parsing and required-field checks. However, production logs show some findings reference line numbers outside the pull request diff, classify test-only issues as production blockers, or include remediation text that contradicts the reported issue. What change would most effectively improve reliability before posting comments to pull requests?
Make every finding field required in the JSON schema so Claude cannot omit uncertain values during automated review generation.
Explanation
Required fields improve structural completeness but can increase fabrication when source information is uncertain or unavailable. They also cannot verify whether a line number exists in the diff or whether severity matches policy.
Replace tool use with markdown output and parse the natural language explanation for contradictions before posting review comments.
Explanation
Parsing natural language is less reliable than extracting structured fields through tool use. This reintroduces formatting and parsing fragility while still failing to guarantee semantic correctness.
Correct answer
Keep tool-based structured output, then add semantic validation against diff metadata, severity rules, and finding consistency before publishing comments.
Explanation
Tool-based structured output solves schema conformance problems such as malformed JSON and missing required fields. It does not guarantee that values are correct, so semantic validation against the pull request diff and review policy is needed before comments are published.
Lower temperature and instruct Claude to double-check every file path, line number, severity, and remediation before returning results.
Explanation
Lower temperature and better instructions may reduce variability, but they remain probabilistic controls. They do not provide a deterministic check that structured values are valid against the actual pull request data.
Overall explanation
Tool use with JSON schemas is the right foundation for machine-readable CI output because it eliminates many syntax and shape failures, such as invalid JSON or missing required fields. However, a schema can confirm that line_number is an integer or severity is an allowed enum, but it cannot inherently prove that the line exists in the pull request diff or that the severity is justified.

The reliable architecture is to keep structured output and add semantic validation before publishing comments. Examples include checking file paths and line numbers against diff metadata, verifying severity against explicit review criteria, detecting duplicate findings, and rejecting internally inconsistent findings for retry or human review.

Making more fields required can worsen hallucination when Claude is forced to fill uncertain values. Switching to markdown and parsing natural language is an anti-pattern because it discards the structured-output reliability that tool use provides. Lowering temperature and asking Claude to double-check can help marginally, but it does not replace deterministic validation.

Scenario: Code Generation with Claude Code You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. Your monorepo stores database migration files in several unrelated locations, including service folders, package folders, and an importer tool. All migration files must follow the same rollback, idempotency, and naming conventions. The team tried local instruction files near some migration folders, but new locations are frequently missed; placing the guidance in the root instructions makes Claude apply migration-specific advice during unrelated edits. What is the most maintainable configuration?
Put migration conventions in root CLAUDE.md and instruct Claude to ignore them when editing non-migration files.
Explanation
Root CLAUDE.md guidance is broadly loaded, so it increases irrelevant context for unrelated tasks. Relying on Claude to ignore always-loaded instructions is less maintainable than loading the guidance only when matching files are involved.
Create a migration skill that developers manually invoke before editing database files in each package.
Explanation
Skills are useful for on-demand workflows, but they require invocation and do not automatically apply conventions based on edited file paths. The requirement is automatic convention loading whenever migration files are touched, not a manual developer step.
Duplicate identical CLAUDE.md files into every current migrations directory and update them manually as packages change.
Explanation
Duplicating instructions across directories creates drift and fails when new migration locations are added. This is an anti-pattern because the convention spans multiple parts of the repository rather than belonging to one stable directory subtree.
Correct answer
Create a .claude/rules/ migration file with paths matching all migration patterns so guidance loads only for those files.
Explanation
Path-scoped rule files are designed for conventions that apply by file pattern rather than by directory hierarchy. This keeps migration guidance automatic for matching files across the monorepo while avoiding irrelevant context during unrelated edits.
Overall explanation
Path-specific rules are the best fit when a convention applies to files spread across multiple unrelated directories. A rule file under .claude/rules/ can use YAML frontmatter with paths patterns so Claude loads the migration guidance only when matching files are edited.

The architectural tradeoff is between precision and context noise. Putting specialized guidance in root CLAUDE.md makes it broadly available, but it also consumes context and can influence unrelated work. Directory-level CLAUDE.md files work well for conventions tied to a stable subtree, but they are brittle when the same file type appears throughout a monorepo.

Duplicating instruction files is a maintainability anti-pattern because copies drift and new directories are easy to miss. A manually invoked skill is also not ideal because the behavior depends on developers remembering to invoke it, while the desired behavior is automatic and path-based.

Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. During a month-long effort to improve your extraction pipeline, Claude Code has explored parsers, JSON schema definitions, validation utilities, fixture documents, and downstream mapping code. After several long sessions, it starts giving answers based on generic extraction patterns rather than specific files it already inspected, and teammates joining later cannot reliably recover the earlier discoveries. What should you do to make later exploration and follow-up changes more reliable?
Correct answer
Have Claude maintain a repository scratchpad file recording discovered schemas, validators, edge cases, and file paths for future reference.
Explanation
A scratchpad file persists key findings outside the volatile conversation context, so later sessions can reload specific discoveries instead of relying on memory. This is especially useful when long codebase exploration causes context degradation or when teammates need to continue from prior work.
Rely on /compact whenever context grows, trusting the compressed conversation to preserve every schema detail and exception.
Explanation
Compaction can reduce context usage, but it is not a reliable persistence mechanism for detailed findings such as field mappings, file paths, and validation edge cases. Important specifics can be condensed or omitted, which is the failure mode already appearing in the workflow.
Continue the same session indefinitely, adding reminders in chat whenever Claude overlooks a previously discovered mapping.
Explanation
Continuing indefinitely worsens context degradation because tool outputs and chat history keep accumulating. Chat reminders are also fragile, since they remain buried in the conversation and can be lost in the middle of long context.
Ask Claude to reread the entire extractor codebase before each new change to refresh all implementation details.
Explanation
Rereading the entire codebase wastes context and time, and it can still lead to attention dilution across many files. It also does not create a durable record that teammates or future sessions can use efficiently.
Overall explanation
Scratchpad files provide durable, explicit memory for long codebase exploration. Having Claude record discovered schemas, validators, edge cases, file paths, and open questions in a repository file gives future sessions and teammates a concise, inspectable source of truth.

The underlying reliability principle is to move critical state out of the transient conversation context and into a persistent artifact. Long sessions can degrade as tool results accumulate, summaries omit details, and the model begins relying on typical patterns instead of specific facts discovered earlier.

/compact can help manage token usage, but it should not be treated as the only record of important implementation knowledge. Rereading the entire codebase before every change is inefficient and increases attention dilution, while indefinitely continuing one session makes the context problem worse rather than solving it.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. You split the support system into a coordinator plus specialized subagents for intake, order investigation, and refund-policy evaluation. Production traces show the refund-policy subagent needs order delivery dates and return-window status in most refund cases, but only the coordinator can currently call lookup_order, adding multiple round trips. The lookup_order tool is read-only, while process_refund changes backend state and escalate_to_human creates a handoff. What change best balances latency reduction with reliable control of sensitive actions?
Give every support subagent access to all four MCP tools so each can resolve cases without coordinator round trips.
Explanation
This over-provisions agents with tools outside their specialization, increasing the chance of tool misuse and unreliable selection. Reducing latency does not justify giving specialized subagents direct access to sensitive state-changing actions.
Create a keyword router that sends any message mentioning refunds directly to process_refund before subagent review.
Explanation
This is an anti-pattern because keyword routing bypasses model reasoning, policy evaluation, and customer-specific context. It also invokes a state-changing tool before eligibility has been established, increasing the risk of incorrect refunds.
Keep all tools coordinator-only and have subagents return natural-language requests whenever they need order or customer details.
Explanation
This preserves strict centralization but fails to address the repeated latency caused by routine read-only lookups. It also forces unnecessary coordinator mediation for information the subagent needs frequently and safely.
Correct answer
Grant the refund-policy subagent scoped access to lookup_order, while keeping process_refund and escalation routed through the coordinator.
Explanation
This gives the subagent the read-only capability it frequently needs while preserving centralized control over state-changing and handoff actions. It applies least privilege rather than exposing the full support toolset to a specialized agent.
Overall explanation
Scoped cross-role access is appropriate when a specialized agent repeatedly needs a narrow capability from another role, especially when that capability is read-only and high frequency. Granting the refund-policy subagent access to lookup_order reduces round trips while preserving the coordinator as the control point for sensitive actions like process_refund and escalate_to_human.

The underlying principle is least privilege with targeted exceptions: agents should have the tools needed for their role, plus limited cross-role tools only when they materially improve workflow efficiency without expanding risk. This improves latency and reliability without collapsing all responsibilities into a single overpowered agent.

Giving every subagent all tools is a tool-distribution anti-pattern because it increases decision complexity and lets agents act outside their specialization. Keeping all tools coordinator-only is safer but inefficient when the repeated need is a low-risk lookup. Keyword routing directly to a mutating tool is especially risky because it replaces contextual reasoning and policy checks with brittle string matching.

Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. A CI job generates test recommendations on every pull request. Developers report that many comments propose tests already present, such as empty-cart checkout and expired-token login cases. The job currently sends Claude only the PR diff and modified source files, then posts every suggested test as a comment. What change would best reduce these duplicate recommendations while preserving useful gap detection?
Have Claude generate a full replacement test suite for the modified module on every pull request run.
Explanation
Generating a replacement suite is unnecessarily broad and risks churn, regressions, or overwriting useful existing tests. It also does not solve the core review problem of producing targeted, non-duplicate recommendations.
Correct answer
Pass the relevant current test files into the review context and ask Claude to target only uncovered behaviors.
Explanation
The current test suite is the evidence Claude needs to distinguish genuine coverage gaps from already-covered scenarios. Providing relevant test files lets Claude compare the proposed changes against existing coverage rather than guessing from implementation files alone.
Raise the severity threshold for generated test suggestions so duplicate scenarios are filtered from pull request comments.
Explanation
Severity thresholds do not reliably identify duplicates because an already-covered scenario can still appear important. This changes comment filtering criteria without giving Claude the information needed to determine whether coverage already exists.
Add a prompt rule saying not to repeat existing coverage, while continuing to provide only implementation diffs.
Explanation
This is an anti-pattern because it asks Claude to avoid duplicates without supplying the current coverage context. A prompt instruction cannot compensate for missing evidence about what tests already exist.
Overall explanation
Relevant context is essential for CI test generation. If Claude only sees the diff and implementation files, it can infer likely tests but cannot know which scenarios the repository already covers. Supplying the relevant existing test files lets Claude compare proposed behaviors against actual coverage and recommend only meaningful gaps.

The underlying principle is context-grounded review: automated feedback should be based on the artifacts needed to make the judgment. Filtering by severity does not identify duplicate coverage, and a prompt rule without test context asks Claude to comply with a constraint it cannot verify. Generating a full replacement suite is also a poor fit because it creates unnecessary code churn rather than targeted pull request feedback.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. Production logs show that during short order-service outages, customers with valid orders are sometimes told that no matching order exists. The same tool response shape is currently used when a search completes with zero matches and when the order backend cannot be reached. What change would best improve the agent's recovery behavior?
Add a prompt instruction telling the agent to apologize and explain uncertainty whenever lookup_order returns empty results.
Explanation
A prompt instruction can improve wording, but it does not fix the tool contract that hides whether the lookup actually completed. The agent still lacks structured information for deciding between clarification, retry, or escalation.
Automatically retry every empty lookup_order response three times before telling customers that no matching orders were found.
Explanation
This treats valid no-match results as failures, wasting time and increasing backend load without improving correctness. It also uses a fixed retry rule rather than letting the tool communicate whether the condition is actually retryable.
Correct answer
Return successful empty results only for completed searches, and structured retryable errors when order lookup cannot access the backend.
Explanation
This separates a valid empty result from an access failure, giving the agent the information needed to choose the right recovery path. A completed search with no matches can prompt clarification, while a backend access failure can trigger retry logic, alternate lookup, or escalation with accurate context.
Treat all lookup_order failures as no-match outcomes, and escalate only if the customer disputes the result.
Explanation
This silently suppresses real access failures and presents misleading information to customers. Waiting for the customer to dispute the result shifts error detection to the user and prevents the agent from recovering intelligently.
Overall explanation
Correct recovery depends on preserving outcome semantics. A successful query with zero matches is not the same as an access failure, even if both currently appear as an empty response. The MCP tool should return an ordinary successful empty result only when the backend search completed, and return a structured failure, such as isError with errorCategory and isRetryable, when the backend could not be reached.

The architectural principle is actionable error propagation. The agent can ask for another identifier when a completed search finds no matches, but it should retry, use an alternate path, or escalate with context when the lookup service is unavailable. Conflating these cases causes false denials, wasted retries, and poor customer experience.

Retrying all empty results is an anti-pattern because valid empty results are not transient failures. Suppressing access failures as no-match outcomes is worse, because it hides reliability problems and makes the final response factually misleading. Prompt-only wording changes may sound safer, but they do not provide the structured state the agent needs for correct control flow.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. A prototype uses specialized subagents for identity verification, billing investigation, return eligibility, and account-risk review. Engineers want billing and returns subagents to pass partial findings directly to each other to resolve linked refund disputes faster. In tests, directly exchanged findings sometimes bypass escalation notes and leave the final customer response missing why one subagent retried a failed lookup. What architecture change best improves reliability without eliminating specialization?
Allow subagents to message each other directly, but require each message to include a free-form summary of rationale.
Explanation
Direct subagent messaging is the behavior causing loss of visibility and inconsistent handoff quality. Free-form summaries remain unreliable because they are not centrally enforced, structured, or consistently available for final resolution synthesis.
Give each subagent access to every MCP tool, so agents can independently verify missing context before responding.
Explanation
Expanding every subagent's tool access weakens specialization and increases the chance of tool misuse. It also does not solve the core routing problem, since important context and errors can still bypass the component responsible for the final response.
Have the last subagent invoked produce the customer response, using whatever findings it has already received.
Explanation
Letting the last subagent respond makes the final answer depend on invocation order rather than complete case understanding. This risks omitting unresolved issues, escalation requirements, and errors encountered by earlier subagents.
Correct answer
Route all subagent requests and results through the coordinator, which records context, errors, and final resolution inputs.
Explanation
Routing communication through the coordinator preserves specialization while giving one component responsibility for observability, error handling, and final aggregation. This directly addresses the missing retry rationale and bypassed escalation notes because all handoffs become visible to the coordinator.
Overall explanation
Coordinator-owned communication is the reliable pattern for multi-agent orchestration when several specialized subagents contribute to one customer outcome. The coordinator should receive subagent requests, results, errors, and partial findings, then decide what context to route next and how to synthesize the final resolution.

This hub-and-spoke design preserves subagent specialization while centralizing observability, error handling, and controlled information flow. In a support setting, that matters because missing retry history, skipped escalation notes, or untracked partial findings can directly affect customer communication and compliance.

Direct subagent-to-subagent messaging is an anti-pattern here because it creates hidden pathways the coordinator cannot audit or reconcile. Giving every subagent all tools expands capability but reduces tool-selection reliability and still leaves aggregation fragmented. Having the last subagent answer makes correctness depend on incidental execution order rather than complete case state.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. During a multi-hour investigation of the refund workflow, the agent correctly identifies several important files, policy branches, and edge cases. Later in the same session, it starts contradicting earlier findings, references generic support-system patterns, and asks to rediscover classes it already inspected. What change would best improve reliability across the rest of the investigation?
Append every raw tool result to each follow-up request so the agent can reconsider all discovered evidence each turn.
Explanation
Carrying every raw result forward increases context pressure and can worsen attention dilution. Verbose tool outputs often contain many irrelevant fields, making it harder for the model to focus on the few facts that matter.
Correct answer
Have agents maintain concise scratchpad files with key findings, file paths, and decisions, then reference them in later prompts.
Explanation
Persistent scratchpad files preserve important discoveries outside the model's shifting conversation context. Referencing those files during later questions helps counteract context degradation and keeps the investigation grounded in previously verified facts.
Use /compact after every major tool call so the entire conversation remains summarized before additional investigation continues.
Explanation
Compaction can reduce context usage, but frequent summarization risks losing precise facts such as file paths, policy conditions, and edge cases. It is useful as a context management tool, but it should not replace explicit persistence of critical findings.
Restart the session whenever answers become inconsistent and require the agent to scan the entire repository again.
Explanation
Restarting and rediscovering the same information wastes time and does not create durable state for the next long investigation. Without persisted findings, the same context degradation problem can recur after the new session grows long.
Overall explanation
Persistent investigation state is the most reliable way to keep long codebase exploration grounded. When a session accumulates many tool results and turns, the model can begin losing track of specific findings, especially exact file paths, policy branches, and implementation details discovered earlier.

A concise scratchpad file gives the agent a durable reference outside the conversational context. The scratchpad should record verified facts, relevant files, open questions, decisions, and source locations, then later prompts should explicitly reference it so the agent does not rely on memory alone.

/compact can help reduce context usage, but summarization may blur or omit critical details. Appending all raw tool outputs is also an anti-pattern because it increases token pressure and attention dilution. Restarting and rescanning the repository avoids stale context temporarily, but it fails to preserve durable state and wastes exploration work.

The underlying principle is to separate working conversation context from persistent structured state during long investigations. Learn more about Claude Code workflows and context-oriented development at Claude Code Overview.

Scenario: Code Generation with Claude Code You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. A three-month pilot dashboard reports 96% reviewer acceptance for Claude Code generated artifacts. Review notes show most accepted outputs are README edits and changelogs, while rejected outputs cluster around OpenAPI response schemas and database migration rollback notes. Leadership wants to stop manual review for any output where Claude reports confidence above 0.9. What is the most reliable next step?
Adopt the 0.9 confidence threshold globally, then monitor incidents and re-enable review if production defects increase.
Explanation
A global self-reported confidence threshold is not enough unless it has been calibrated against labeled review outcomes. Waiting for production defects is reactive and risks letting known weak segments bypass review.
Correct answer
Break down validation results by artifact category and generated field, then reduce review only for consistently reliable segments.
Explanation
Aggregate acceptance can hide weak performance in specific artifact categories or fields. This approach uses the review evidence already available to determine where automation is reliable before reducing human oversight.
Increase the overall random sample size for two more sprints, then decide using the combined acceptance rate.
Explanation
A larger pooled sample can still be dominated by easy, common artifacts such as README edits and changelogs. The problem is not insufficient aggregate data, it is that reliability varies across artifact types and fields.
Require reviewers to check only low-confidence outputs, since high-confidence Claude Code results already passed aggregate evaluation.
Explanation
High confidence does not automatically mean high accuracy without calibration. This would remove review from the exact outputs leadership wants to trust, even though known rejection clusters remain unresolved.
Overall explanation
Segmented validation is the reliable way to decide where human review can be safely reduced. A high aggregate acceptance rate can mask poor performance on specific artifact types, such as API schemas, or specific generated fields, such as rollback instructions.

Confidence calibration requires comparing model-reported confidence against labeled reviewer outcomes, then setting review thresholds only where the data shows consistent reliability. In practice, teams should analyze accuracy by artifact category and field, then keep human review for segments with elevated error rates or ambiguous requirements.

The anti-patterns are using a global confidence cutoff, relying on a larger pooled acceptance rate, or waiting for production incidents before restoring review. These approaches ignore the observed clustering of failures and can undermine trust in otherwise useful automation.

The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. Production QA finds final replies often address refunds and returns but overlook shipping address corrections or unresolved account-lock evidence. Logs show subagents return partial findings successfully, but the coordinator accepts the first synthesized reply. Which change best improves completeness without escalating every multi-concern case?
Correct answer
Have the coordinator compare the draft resolution with the original request, assign targeted follow-up subagent work, then rerun synthesis.
Explanation
This adds an explicit coordinator review step before finalizing the customer response. The coordinator can identify missing or weakly supported parts of the case, send only targeted follow-up work to the relevant subagents, and synthesize a more complete answer without unnecessary human escalation.
Let the synthesis subagent directly contact investigation subagents for missing details, bypassing coordinator turns to reduce handoff latency.
Explanation
Direct subagent-to-subagent communication reduces coordinator visibility and weakens centralized error handling. In coordinator-subagent patterns, the coordinator should manage information routing so the system maintains observability, controlled context flow, and consistent recovery behavior.
Run the complete fixed subagent pipeline twice for every complex case, keeping whichever final answer is longer.
Explanation
Repeating the entire pipeline wastes work and does not focus on the specific unresolved parts of the case. Choosing the longer answer is an anti-pattern because length does not indicate correctness, coverage, or policy compliance.
Instruct each subagent to include an overall confidence score, then escalate cases whenever any score falls below 0.8.
Explanation
A single self-reported confidence score is not a reliable proxy for actual case completeness or customer impact. This would likely over-escalate cases that could be resolved through targeted follow-up, reducing first-contact resolution rather than improving it.
Overall explanation
Coordinator-led refinement is the best fit when subagents complete their assigned work but the final customer response is incomplete. The coordinator should compare the synthesized draft against the original customer request and available findings, then request targeted follow-up from the relevant subagents before rerunning synthesis.

The underlying principle is that the coordinator owns task decomposition, result aggregation, and quality control. This preserves the hub-and-spoke architecture while avoiding unnecessary escalation and avoiding a wasteful full rerun of all subagents.

Allowing subagents to coordinate directly bypasses the coordinator, which undermines observability and consistent error handling. Escalating based on self-reported confidence is also unreliable, and selecting the longer result from repeated fixed pipelines confuses verbosity with completeness.

The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. You added an order-investigation subagent that checks identity and order state before the coordinator decides whether to refund or escalate. Production traces show many escalations where the only subagent output is <code>{"status":"failed","message":"backend unavailable"}</code>. Manual review finds some cases had a verified customer record, a timeout on only one order lookup, and cached order summaries that could have supported a safe response. What change would best enable the coordinator to recover more intelligently?
Retry lookup_order several times inside the subagent, then return a single backend unavailable message to the coordinator.
Explanation
Local retries can be useful for transient failures, but collapsing the final outcome into a generic message still hides the important details. The coordinator remains unable to tell what succeeded, what failed, and what recovery paths remain available.
Correct answer
Return error details that include failure type, attempted order lookup, partial customer data, cached summaries, and suggested fallback actions.
Explanation
This gives the coordinator enough context to distinguish a total backend outage from a localized lookup failure. With failure type, attempted operation, partial results, and alternatives, the coordinator can retry selectively, use safe cached data, ask for clarification, or escalate with a useful handoff.
Convert lookup_order timeouts into successful empty results so the coordinator can continue without triggering unnecessary escalations.
Explanation
This silently suppresses an access failure by pretending it was a valid no-results response. The coordinator may produce an incorrect resolution because it cannot distinguish no matching order from an unavailable order service.
Escalate any case after one order lookup failure, since support workflows should avoid acting on incomplete backend data.
Explanation
Immediate escalation is safer than pretending a failure succeeded, but it sacrifices recoverable cases unnecessarily. A single failed lookup does not prove the entire workflow is unsafe when verified customer data, partial results, or alternative actions may exist.
Overall explanation
Structured error propagation lets a coordinator make informed recovery decisions instead of treating every subagent failure as identical. In this situation, the coordinator needs to know what failed, what was attempted, what partial information is still trustworthy, and what alternatives might be available.

The underlying reliability principle is that a generic status like backend unavailable hides operational context. It prevents the coordinator from distinguishing a transient timeout from a permission problem, a single failed lookup from a broader outage, or a valid empty result from an access failure.

Retrying locally can be helpful, but returning only a generic final error still blocks intelligent coordinator behavior. Marking a timeout as a successful empty result is an anti-pattern because it suppresses the error and risks an incorrect customer response. Escalating after any single lookup failure is also too blunt when partial results or safe fallbacks could preserve first-contact resolution.

Scenario: Code Generation with Claude Code You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. Your team added a custom review workflow that summarizes generated code changes into structured records containing modified files, test coverage, security impact, rollback risk, and reviewer recommendation. Each record currently has one overall confidence score. In pilot runs, high-scoring records often have accurate file lists and test summaries but occasionally miss rollback or security concerns, which are the highest-risk fields. What change would best support safe routing of low-risk records while preserving reviewer attention for uncertain areas?
Send every generated record to senior reviewers until the workflow reaches a stable overall accuracy percentage for one month.
Explanation
Reviewing everything is safe but does not create an efficient routing strategy or identify which fields drive risk. A stable aggregate accuracy metric can still mask poor performance on rollback or security fields.
Reduce confidence variance by forcing Claude Code to output only high, medium, or low confidence for each record.
Explanation
Coarser confidence labels may look cleaner, but they do not make confidence calibrated or reliable. Without labeled validation data, the labels remain untested signals and cannot safely drive review routing.
Correct answer
Require confidence per critical record field, then calibrate routing thresholds using a labeled set of previously reviewed changes.
Explanation
Different fields have different error profiles, so a single overall score can hide uncertainty in high-risk areas. Calibrating field-level thresholds against labeled review data lets the team route records based on measured reliability rather than unvalidated confidence claims.
Automatically approve records above a fixed overall confidence threshold after adding instructions to be conservative on risky changes.
Explanation
A fixed threshold on overall confidence repeats the failure mode described in the pilot, where high overall scores hide weak rollback or security fields. General instructions like being conservative do not provide measured calibration or field-specific reliability.
Overall explanation
Field-level calibration is the right pattern when different parts of a generated artifact have different risk and accuracy profiles. In this situation, accurate file lists and test summaries do not compensate for missed rollback or security concerns, so routing decisions need confidence signals tied to each critical field rather than one aggregate score.

The underlying reliability principle is that confidence must be validated, not merely reported. A labeled set of previously reviewed changes lets the team measure how well each confidence score predicts correctness, then set review thresholds that preserve human attention for uncertain or high-risk fields.

Using a fixed overall threshold is an anti-pattern because it can automate the exact failures that reviewers are finding. Reviewing everything avoids automation risk but does not solve reviewer capacity allocation, and aggregate accuracy can hide weak segments. Coarse labels such as high, medium, and low are also insufficient unless they are calibrated against labeled outcomes.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. After adding regional order backends, production traces show the agent sometimes misreads raw lookup_order payloads: one region returns status_code: 3, another returns state: "RETURN_PENDING", and a third includes nested timestamps. The agent's final responses are inconsistent, even though each backend response is technically valid. What change best improves reliability without modifying every MCP tool implementation?
Parse the assistant's final text for status words and retry lookup_order whenever inconsistent wording appears.
Explanation
Parsing natural language output for recovery is an anti-pattern because final response wording is not a reliable control signal. It detects symptoms after reasoning has already been affected by inconsistent raw data.
Correct answer
Add a PostToolUse hook that transforms lookup_order outputs into a canonical support-case structure before Claude receives them.
Explanation
A PostToolUse hook is designed to intercept tool results after execution and transform them before the model reasons over them. This centralizes normalization outside individual MCP tools, reducing inconsistency while preserving each backend integration.
Require each customer message to include the customer's region so Claude can choose the correct payload interpretation.
Explanation
This shifts backend integration complexity onto the customer and still requires Claude to interpret raw schemas correctly. Region selection does not solve inconsistent field names, nested formats, or code mappings in tool results.
Expand the system prompt with every regional status mapping and ask Claude to normalize payloads during response generation.
Explanation
Prompt instructions can help, but they leave normalization to probabilistic model behavior at the moment of reasoning. When backend payloads vary systematically, central transformation before model processing is more reliable and easier to maintain.
Overall explanation
Post-tool result transformation is the appropriate pattern when valid tool outputs arrive in inconsistent shapes that can confuse downstream reasoning. A PostToolUse hook can convert regional fields, status codes, and timestamp formats into a canonical structure before Claude incorporates the result into its next decision.

The architectural principle is to make the model reason over stable semantic inputs rather than repeatedly asking it to interpret heterogeneous backend payloads. This keeps the MCP tools focused on integration while centralizing cross-tool or cross-region normalization in a deterministic layer.

Expanding the prompt with mappings relies on probabilistic compliance and increases context burden. Asking customers for region information does not address schema differences within tool outputs. Parsing final assistant text for inconsistency is especially fragile because natural language is an output surface, not a dependable workflow control mechanism.

It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. After the coordinator verifies a customer and retrieves two recent orders, it invokes a refund-policy subagent to assess eligibility. In production, the subagent often ignores the verified customer ID and latest order status, then asks for details already present in the coordinator's transcript. Logs show the Task prompt only says, "assess refund eligibility for this customer." What change best addresses this reliability issue?
Rely on a prior refund-policy subagent invocation to remember customer context for subsequent eligibility checks.
Explanation
Subagent invocations should not be treated as shared memory stores across tasks. Depending on prior subagent state is an anti-pattern because each invocation needs the relevant context supplied explicitly.
Correct answer
Populate each Task prompt with the verified customer facts, relevant order records, prior findings, and needed decision criteria.
Explanation
Subagents operate with isolated context, so they cannot automatically see the coordinator's transcript or tool results. Including the relevant facts and prior findings directly in the Task prompt gives the subagent the information needed to make a reliable eligibility decision.
Have the subagent call get_customer and lookup_order again whenever details are missing from its prompt.
Explanation
Repeating backend lookups may sometimes recover missing information, but it is an inefficient workaround for a handoff design flaw. It can increase latency, duplicate tool usage, and still fail if the subagent lacks the right identifiers or tool access.
Keep the facts in the coordinator transcript and instruct subagents to review the parent conversation before deciding.
Explanation
This assumes subagents can inspect the coordinator's conversation history, which they do not inherit automatically. Prompting the subagent to review unavailable context will not fix the missing information problem.
Overall explanation
Subagent invocation requires explicit context passing. In coordinator-subagent architectures, a subagent does not automatically inherit the coordinator's conversation history, prior tool results, or memory from earlier invocations. The reliable pattern is to include the verified customer facts, relevant order data, prior findings, and decision criteria directly in the Task prompt.

This approach works because the subagent receives the complete case state needed for its specialized reasoning without relying on hidden or unavailable context. In production systems, these handoffs are often best represented as structured records, such as customer ID, order IDs, statuses, dates, amounts, and policy questions, so the receiving subagent can reason over precise facts.

Keeping facts only in the coordinator transcript fails because the subagent cannot inspect that transcript unless the coordinator passes the information. Recalling prior subagent invocations is also unreliable because subagents should not be treated as persistent shared memory. Re-running backend tools can sometimes compensate for missing facts, but it adds latency and avoids fixing the root handoff problem.

The underlying principle is context isolation by design: the coordinator owns orchestration and must package the information each subagent needs. Learn more about agent and subagent patterns in the Agent SDK documentation and tool-result handling in Tool Use.

It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. During a pilot, the agent often spends its first two turns asking backend tools what refund policies, return reason codes, and escalation queues exist. These lists are read-only, change weekly, and help the agent choose the right customer-specific actions, but the extra calls increase latency and sometimes consume context before order lookup. Which MCP integration change best addresses this issue?
Correct answer
Expose the read-only policy, reason-code, and queue catalogs as MCP resources, while keeping customer-changing operations as tools.
Explanation
MCP resources are appropriate for read-only catalogs that provide context about available data or policy options. This reduces exploratory tool calls while preserving tools for model-driven actions such as looking up orders, processing refunds, or escalating cases.
Instruct the agent to skip catalog discovery unless its response text mentions uncertainty about policy applicability.
Explanation
Parsing the assistant's natural language text to control tool behavior is an agentic loop anti-pattern. It relies on incidental wording rather than a reliable architectural separation between reference context and executable actions.
Combine catalog listing and action execution into each backend tool so every call returns available policies and queues.
Explanation
Adding catalog data to every tool response bloats tool outputs and causes irrelevant information to accumulate in the conversation. It also blurs tool boundaries, making action tools harder for the model to select and interpret reliably.
Add a mandatory first-turn tool_choice forcing list_policy_catalog before any customer lookup, then let normal tool selection resume.
Explanation
Forcing a catalog tool call preserves the latency and context overhead that the design is trying to remove. It may make ordering more consistent, but it still treats static reference context as an action the model must repeatedly request.
Overall explanation
MCP resources are the right fit for read-only catalogs such as policy indexes, return reason codes, escalation queue lists, and documentation hierarchies. They expose useful context to the application or agent without requiring Claude to spend tool calls discovering what information exists before it can act.

The key architectural distinction is resources for context and tools for actions. Customer-specific operations such as lookup_order, process_refund, and escalate_to_human should remain tools because Claude decides when to execute them, while stable catalogs can be surfaced as resources to reduce unnecessary exploration.

Forcing a first tool call with tool_choice still incurs repeated latency and context overhead. Combining catalogs into every action tool creates verbose outputs and muddier tool contracts. Controlling behavior by parsing the assistant's natural language uncertainty is especially fragile because loop control should rely on structured signals and interface design, not incidental text.

Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. Developers repeatedly ask Claude Code to run the same pre-PR test-gap analysis. The workflow needs a reusable checklist, should prompt for a target diff or file pattern when omitted, and must avoid tools unrelated to reading files and writing the generated test plan. Which configuration best supports this workflow?
Correct answer
Create a project skill in .claude/skills/test-gap-review/SKILL.md, configuring argument-hint and allowed-tools frontmatter, then include the reusable checklist.
Explanation
A project skill packages a reusable task-specific workflow in the repository, making it available to the team. The SKILL.md frontmatter supports configuration such as argument-hint for missing inputs and allowed-tools for limiting tool access during skill execution.
Store the workflow in ~/.claude/skills/test-gap-review/SKILL.md so every contributor inherits the same skill configuration automatically during CI work.
Explanation
The ~/.claude/skills/ location is user-scoped, so it is for personal skills rather than team-shared repository workflows. Other contributors would not automatically receive that configuration through version control.
Add the checklist to project CLAUDE.md and ask developers to remember expected arguments and permitted tools.
Explanation
CLAUDE.md is appropriate for always-loaded project context and universal standards, not task-specific invocation behavior. Relying on developers to remember arguments and tool boundaries is an anti-pattern when Claude Code provides explicit skill configuration for those concerns.
Create a project slash command in .claude/commands/test-gap-review.md and document tool restrictions inside the command instructions.
Explanation
A project slash command can make a reusable prompt available, but this does not best satisfy the need for skill frontmatter configuration. Documenting tool restrictions in prose is weaker than configuring allowed-tools for the skill execution context.
Overall explanation
Project skills are the best fit for reusable, task-specific Claude Code workflows that need configurable execution behavior. Placing a skill under .claude/skills/ with a SKILL.md file lets the team share the workflow through version control, while frontmatter such as argument-hint and allowed-tools improves invocation quality and constrains tool access.

The underlying tradeoff is between always-loaded guidance and on-demand workflow packaging. CLAUDE.md is better for universal project standards that should apply broadly, while a skill is better for a repeatable workflow developers invoke only when needed.

A slash command can be useful for simple reusable prompts, but documenting tool boundaries inside instructions is less appropriate than using skill frontmatter when tool access must be constrained. A user-scoped skill under ~/.claude/skills/ is also unsuitable for a shared team workflow because it will not be distributed with the repository.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. In a customer support resolution agent using Claude Agent SDK and MCP-backed support tooling, you add an MCP server with policy_search and case_history_search tools that use backend ranking, policy metadata, and customer-safe summaries. In evaluation runs, Claude frequently searches raw policy markdown files instead and sometimes returns outdated refund rules. The MCP tools are connected and return better results when explicitly called, but they are rarely chosen spontaneously. What is the most effective first change?
Merge the MCP policy tools into one broad support_lookup tool that searches customers, orders, refunds, and policy files together.
Explanation
A broad consolidated tool increases ambiguity and mixes distinct data domains with different safety and workflow requirements. This can worsen tool selection reliability and encourage unnecessary overfetching rather than improving adoption of the right MCP tool.
Add a system prompt rule that says MCP tools are always preferred whenever a customer request mentions returns or billing.
Explanation
A broad prompt rule is keyword-sensitive and can create inappropriate tool use when returns or billing are mentioned in unrelated contexts. It also does not explain the MCP tools' capabilities or outputs, so selection remains brittle.
Correct answer
Rewrite the MCP tool descriptions to detail support-specific capabilities, accepted identifiers, returned fields, and when to use them instead of generic search.
Explanation
Tool descriptions are the primary signal Claude uses to decide which tools to call. Describing capabilities, inputs, outputs, and boundaries helps the agent understand why the MCP tools are more appropriate than raw file search for policy and case retrieval.
Disable generic file-search tools for all sessions so the agent cannot inspect policy documents without calling the MCP server.
Explanation
This is a blunt restriction that can break legitimate file inspection and debugging workflows. The problem is not that generic search exists, it is that the agent lacks enough guidance to select the more capable MCP tools reliably.
Overall explanation
Effective MCP adoption depends on clear tool descriptions. When a more capable MCP tool is available but Claude keeps using a generic built-in search path, the first fix is usually to improve the MCP tool descriptions so the model understands what the tool does, what inputs it accepts, what outputs it returns, and when it should be preferred.

The underlying principle is that tool descriptions are part of the agent interface, not merely documentation for humans. Descriptions should make the MCP tool's value obvious, for example that policy_search returns ranked current policy results with effective dates and source identifiers, while generic file search may surface stale or incomplete markdown.

Disabling generic file-search tools is an anti-pattern because it reduces useful flexibility and treats the symptom rather than the selection signal. A vague prompt rule like “always prefer MCP tools” is also brittle because it relies on keyword matching and may override better judgment. Combining unrelated support functions into one broad lookup tool increases ambiguity and makes the tool boundary less clear.

Scenario: Code Generation with Claude Code You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. Your nightly CI job asks Claude Code to propose tests for changed modules. Suggestions are consistently low value: duplicating brittle snapshots, mocking helpers your repository already provides, and ignoring team rules that prioritize behavior tests over implementation details. Developers run the job from ephemeral runners, so ad hoc local preferences are not present. What change would most effectively improve the quality and consistency of generated test suggestions?
Correct answer
Commit project-level CLAUDE.md guidance describing valuable test criteria, fixture conventions, and reusable helpers for CI-invoked Claude Code.
Explanation
Project-level CLAUDE.md provides repository-scoped context that CI-invoked Claude Code can load consistently across ephemeral runners. Documenting test criteria, fixtures, and reusable helpers directly addresses why generated suggestions are low value and inconsistent with team practice.
Store preferred testing style in ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md on the maintainer's laptop and copy outputs into pull requests.
Explanation
User-level CLAUDE.md content applies only to that user's environment and will not be available on ephemeral CI runners. Copying outputs manually also undermines the goal of a consistent automated CI workflow shared by the team.
Add a prompt line asking Claude to be conservative and avoid unnecessary tests whenever reviewing changed files in CI.
Explanation
A vague instruction like being conservative does not define which tests are valuable or which existing fixtures should be reused. It may reduce the number of suggestions, but it will not reliably align test generation with repository-specific testing standards.
Require developers to omit existing test files from CI context so Claude infers coverage needs from product code alone.
Explanation
Withholding relevant tests removes the evidence Claude needs to avoid duplicate scenarios and follow existing conventions. Inferring coverage from product code alone is an anti-pattern when the problem is lack of repository-specific testing context.
Overall explanation
Project-scoped guidance is the right fit when CI-invoked Claude Code needs stable repository context that applies across runners and developers. A committed CLAUDE.md can describe what the team considers valuable tests, how fixtures should be used, and which helper patterns should be preferred.

The underlying principle is that automated Claude Code workflows need the same durable project context that a developer would rely on locally. Vague prompts such as be conservative do not teach repository-specific standards, and user-level memory files such as ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md are not shared with CI or teammates.

Omitting existing tests is also counterproductive because Claude needs those files or documented conventions to avoid duplicate test scenarios and match established patterns.

Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. A pilot processes 30 contracts per run. Accuracy is high on early documents but declines later: clauses copied from earlier contracts appear in later extractions, and page references from middle documents are dropped. Trace logs show raw outputs from OCR, table parsing, and validation tools dominate the request history, including coordinates, styling data, alternate OCR hypotheses, debug IDs, and validator traces. Downstream extraction only uses clause text, page number, document ID, confidence, and validation status. The operations team also needs original tool responses available for traceability. What change best addresses the reliability problem?
Replace accumulated tool results with brief prose summaries after every fixed batch of five processed documents.
Explanation
Prose summaries can lose exact values, page references, confidence fields, and validation status needed for structured extraction. A fixed batch interval is also arbitrary and does not distinguish critical fields from expendable diagnostic noise.
Increase max_tokens and reduce each request to fewer documents while leaving the tool result payloads unchanged.
Explanation
Increasing max_tokens primarily affects the response budget, not the quality of accumulated input context. Smaller batches may delay the problem, but leaving the verbose payloads unchanged fails to address the root cause.
Keep all raw tool outputs in conversation history so Claude can independently determine which details remain important.
Explanation
This is the anti-pattern causing the observed degradation: it lets verbose tool payloads accumulate until they dominate the context. Claude may not reliably attend to the relevant details when large volumes of low-value fields are carried forward.
Correct answer
Add a preprocessing layer that stores full tool outputs externally and appends only schema-relevant fields and provenance to conversation history.
Explanation
Tool results become part of the conversation context, so verbose outputs can crowd out the information Claude actually needs for later reasoning. This approach preserves traceability outside the model context while keeping the prompt focused on extraction-relevant facts and provenance.
Overall explanation
Tool result accumulation is a common reliability problem in long extraction workflows because every tool_result added to conversation history competes for attention with later documents and instructions. The practical fix is to preserve full raw outputs in an external trace store while appending only the fields Claude needs for reasoning, such as extracted text, document identifiers, page references, confidence, validation status, and provenance.

The underlying principle is context hygiene: manage what enters the model context rather than assuming the model will ignore irrelevant fields. Keeping raw tool payloads in history amplifies lost-in-the-middle effects and wastes context on coordinates, debug IDs, and alternate hypotheses that downstream extraction does not use.

Brief prose summaries are risky for structured extraction because they can blur exact numbers, dates, page references, and confidence values. Increasing max_tokens or reducing batch size may reduce symptoms temporarily, but it does not solve the architectural issue of verbose, low-value tool outputs accumulating in the prompt.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. In testing, complex customer messages with several concerns take too long. For example, "refund the damaged item, explain a duplicate charge, and update my locked account email" causes the returns, billing, and account subagents to each retrieve the customer profile and inspect the same order history before producing overlapping summaries. Some issues are still missed because each subagent spends context on the entire case rather than its specialty. What orchestration change best addresses this?
Route all cases through the same fixed sequence of subagents so each can review identical tool results before responding.
Explanation
A fixed pipeline increases unnecessary work for simple cases and does not solve overlapping investigation in complex cases. It also reduces the coordinator's ability to adapt delegation based on the actual customer request.
Allow specialized subagents to message each other directly whenever overlap appears, reducing coordinator involvement during investigation.
Explanation
Direct subagent communication weakens observability, consistent error handling, and controlled information flow. In coordinator-subagent architectures, the coordinator should manage routing and aggregation rather than letting subagents form ad hoc communication paths.
Correct answer
Have the coordinator assign each subagent a distinct concern and shared verified facts, then combine findings into one customer response.
Explanation
This keeps subagents focused on their specialization while preventing repeated investigation of the same customer and order facts. The coordinator remains responsible for routing, shared context, aggregation, and producing a unified resolution across all concerns.
Have every subagent independently investigate the full case, then let the coordinator choose the most complete final answer.
Explanation
This preserves the duplication already causing latency and context waste. It also risks missing issues because each subagent continues spending attention on the entire case instead of its specialized concern.
Overall explanation
Correct orchestration keeps the coordinator responsible for decomposition, routing, and synthesis while giving each subagent a non-overlapping slice of the work. In this support case, the coordinator should pass shared verified facts once, assign the refund, billing, and account concerns to the appropriate specialists, then merge their outputs into a single customer-facing response.

The underlying principle is scope partitioning: subagents are most reliable when their prompts focus attention on a distinct responsibility instead of asking every agent to investigate the full case. This reduces duplicated tool calls, lowers latency, and improves coverage because each subagent spends its context budget on the part it is best suited to analyze.

Having every subagent investigate everything is an anti-pattern because it amplifies duplication and forces the coordinator to reconcile redundant outputs. A fixed sequence of subagents is also inefficient because it ignores request complexity and may invoke irrelevant specialists. Allowing direct subagent communication bypasses the hub-and-spoke pattern, making state, errors, and handoffs harder to observe and control.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. During a maintenance task, Claude must update refund eligibility rules that may live in several packages. Recent attempts used broad repository reads, filling context with unrelated source files before finding the relevant configuration and test fixtures. The files follow naming conventions such as refund-policy.yaml, return-policy.json, and *.refund.test.ts, but their directories vary across services. What should you have Claude do first?
Use Read on each service directory recursively, then ask Claude to infer which files match the policy naming conventions.
Explanation
Recursively reading directories or files before narrowing the candidate set wastes context and increases the chance that important files are missed. This approach reverses the efficient exploration pattern: identify matching paths first, then read selected files.
Correct answer
Use Glob with targeted filename patterns to list candidate policy and refund test files, then Read only the relevant matches.
Explanation
Glob is the appropriate built-in tool when the selection criterion is a file path or filename pattern rather than file contents. Listing candidate paths first keeps context focused and avoids loading unrelated files before Claude knows which files matter.
Use Bash to run recursive find commands for every possible extension, then paste the full command output into context.
Explanation
Bash can perform filesystem searches, but it is less appropriate when a purpose-built built-in file pattern tool is available. Dumping full command output into context is an anti-pattern because it can add noisy paths and reduce attention on the relevant files.
Use Grep for refund and return keywords across the repository, then Read every file containing either term.
Explanation
Grep is better for searching file contents, not for finding files by path or extension pattern. Keyword search can return many irrelevant implementation files, comments, and logs, which recreates the context bloat seen in the failed attempts.
Overall explanation
Glob is the right first step when Claude needs to find files by name, extension, or path convention, such as *.refund.test.ts or *policy*.yaml. It produces a focused list of candidate paths so the next step can use Read only on files likely to matter.

The underlying principle is context-efficient codebase exploration: narrow the search space before loading file contents. Grep is valuable when searching for text inside files, but it is noisy when the actual selection rule is based on filenames or path patterns.

Using Bash for ad hoc recursive searches may work, but it bypasses the simpler built-in tool designed for this job and often leads to excessive output. Recursively reading directories is a clear anti-pattern because it consumes context before relevance is established.

Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. A nightly extraction job processes supplier contracts into a structured record for downstream procurement systems. Validation now rejects many records because renewal dates are earlier than start dates, currency codes are copied into amount fields, and a required payment_terms field is filled with plausible but unsupported values. The current retry prompt says only, "Fix the invalid fields and return the corrected record." Which change would most effectively improve recoverable retry quality?
Apply deterministic post-processing rules that swap invalid dates and blank unsupported fields before sending records downstream.
Explanation
Heuristic patching can hide extraction errors rather than correct them from source evidence. Swapping dates or blanking fields may create records that pass validation while misrepresenting the original contract.
Correct answer
Retry with the source document, rejected extraction, and exact validator messages, instructing Claude to produce a corrected record only.
Explanation
This gives Claude the evidence, the previous mistaken interpretation, and the precise reasons the output failed. Including all three elements supports targeted self-correction rather than asking the model to guess what went wrong.
Increase the retry count and ask Claude to be more careful until the record passes all procurement validations.
Explanation
Repeated vague retries are an anti-pattern because they add cost and latency without supplying actionable feedback. Asking Claude to be more careful does not identify which fields failed or provide evidence for correction.
Retry with only the validator messages, omitting the contract text to reduce context size and focus correction effort.
Explanation
Validator messages identify what failed but do not provide the source evidence needed to correct the fields. Without the contract text, Claude may fill missing details from assumptions or repeat unsupported values.
Overall explanation
Retry-with-feedback works best when the follow-up request includes the original source, the failed structured output, and the specific validation errors. This combination lets Claude compare its prior extraction against the source evidence and make targeted corrections, such as fixing date relationships or removing unsupported values.

The underlying principle is that retries are useful for recoverable extraction failures, such as format mismatches, field placement mistakes, or semantic validation failures where the correct information exists in the provided document. The retry should not simply demand better behavior, it should provide concrete feedback about what failed and enough context to repair it.

Using only validator messages deprives the model of source evidence, while deterministic patching can create superficially valid but incorrect records. Increasing retry counts with vague instructions is another anti-pattern because it relies on repetition rather than actionable feedback.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. During intake testing, when a customer provides enough identifying details but asks, "Can you just check this?", the agent sometimes replies with generic guidance instead of using any backend tool. You do not know in advance whether get_customer, lookup_order, or escalate_to_human is appropriate, but every production response must be grounded in at least one backend action. What configuration best addresses this behavior?
Keep tool_choice on auto and strengthen system prompt instructions requiring backend lookup before every customer-facing response.
Explanation
The auto setting permits Claude to return text without calling a tool, which is the observed failure mode. Stronger instructions may reduce the issue, but they do not guarantee a tool call when production behavior requires one.
Force get_customer as the required tool for all turns, then let Claude decide whether additional tools are needed.
Explanation
Forcing one specific tool is too rigid when the appropriate backend action may be an order lookup or human escalation. It can introduce unnecessary or incorrect tool calls by removing model-driven selection among valid tools.
Correct answer
Configure tool_choice to any so Claude must call one available tool while retaining model-driven selection among applicable tools.
Explanation
This configuration guarantees that Claude calls a tool rather than returning conversational text, while still allowing it to choose the most appropriate available tool. It fits the situation because the required behavior is tool use in general, not a predetermined first tool.
Retry whenever assistant text sounds generic, using phrase matching to continue the loop until a tool appears.
Explanation
Parsing natural language text to control agent behavior is brittle and can fail when wording changes. Loop control should rely on structured API behavior and tool configuration, not subjective phrase matching.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: When at least one backend action is required but the specific tool should remain model-selected, configure tool_choice as {"type":"any"}. This prevents a purely conversational response while preserving Claude's ability to choose among tools such as get_customer, lookup_order, or escalate_to_human.

Underlying principle: Use tool choice configuration to express the control requirement precisely. auto is appropriate when a tool call is optional, any is appropriate when some tool must be called, and forced tool selection is appropriate only when one specific tool must be called.

Why the alternatives fail: Prompt-only instructions with auto still allow text responses, so they do not address the production reliability requirement. Forcing get_customer over-constrains the agent when another tool may be the right action. Retrying based on generic-sounding assistant text is an anti-pattern because natural language is not a reliable control signal.

Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Your extraction schema classifies vendor contract clauses using a required enum: termination, indemnity, liability, confidentiality, payment. In validation logs, unusual clauses are being forced into the nearest allowed category, while genuinely ambiguous clauses are returned with confident but inconsistent labels. Downstream analytics need stable categories without losing information from unexpected clause types. What schema adjustment best handles these edge cases?
Make category a required unrestricted string so Claude can invent precise labels for every unexpected clause type.
Explanation
An unrestricted string allows unlimited variation, which weakens downstream analytics that depend on normalized categories. It also increases the risk of inconsistent labels for the same clause type across documents.
Correct answer
Add enum values for ambiguous cases and a fallback category paired with a required free-text detail field.
Explanation
This preserves stable machine-readable categories while giving the model a safe way to represent uncertainty and unexpected clause types. The detail field captures the specific label or explanation needed by downstream systems without forcing inaccurate classification.
Remove the category field and rely on downstream systems to infer classifications from extracted clause text.
Explanation
Removing the structured category shifts the classification problem downstream and makes the extraction less useful for automated processing. It avoids misclassification in the schema only by abandoning the normalized signal that analytics require.
Keep the closed enum and instruct Claude to choose the closest category whenever the source is unclear.
Explanation
Forcing the closest category is exactly the failure mode shown in the logs. It produces schema-valid output, but the categories become semantically wrong and overconfident when the source is ambiguous or outside the known taxonomy.
Overall explanation
Robust schema design should preserve normalized outputs while giving Claude explicit ways to represent uncertainty and taxonomy gaps. Adding an ambiguity value such as unclear and an extensible fallback such as other with a required detail field prevents the model from forcing unsupported values into the nearest allowed category.

The underlying tradeoff is between closed-world consistency and real-world variability. A strict enum is valuable for downstream systems, but it needs escape hatches for cases the taxonomy does not yet cover. The detail field retains information that can later support taxonomy refinement or human review.

Using an unrestricted string sacrifices normalization and causes label drift, while forcing the closest enum value creates schema-valid but semantically misleading output. Removing the category field avoids one error mode but eliminates the structured signal downstream analytics need.

Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. A QA prompt flags extraction problems before records reach reviewers. In pilot results, most total-mismatch and missing-signature findings are confirmed, but a new "possible payment-term ambiguity" category is usually dismissed. Reviewers now skim the entire finding feed and miss confirmed total mismatches. What should you change first?
Increase the sample size in aggregate accuracy reports and reassure reviewers that overall precision remains above launch targets.
Explanation
Aggregate metrics do not solve the reviewer trust issue when one category creates many visible false positives. Even if overall precision looks acceptable, the noisy category can still cause reviewers to ignore accurate findings in other categories.
Correct answer
Separate findings by category and severity, tighten criteria for noisy checks, and prioritize high-precision issues in reviewer queues.
Explanation
This addresses the trust problem directly by preventing a noisy category from contaminating reviewer confidence in reliable findings. Tightening criteria for the problematic category while prioritizing high-precision issues preserves attention for findings that reviewers should act on.
Combine all findings into one confidence-sorted queue, instructing reviewers to ignore any item that appears low impact.
Explanation
A single mixed queue is part of the problem because false positives in one category can make reviewers distrust the entire feed. Asking reviewers to manually ignore low-impact findings shifts the burden to humans rather than improving the system's precision and presentation.
Add a global "be conservative" instruction and suppress findings whenever Claude reports confidence below a fixed threshold.
Explanation
General instructions like "be conservative" are weaker than category-specific reporting criteria and often do not reliably reduce false positives. A fixed confidence threshold can also hide important findings while failing to address why one category is noisy.
Overall explanation
Reviewer trust is category-sensitive. When one finding type produces frequent false positives, reviewers may stop trusting the entire output stream, including categories that are actually accurate and valuable.

The practical response is to avoid an undifferentiated feed: use explicit category and severity criteria, tighten the noisy category, and make high-precision findings easier to act on. This preserves reviewer attention for critical validated issues while giving the team room to improve ambiguous checks.

Anti-patterns include relying on vague instructions such as "be conservative", sorting everything by a self-reported confidence score, or hiding the issue behind aggregate precision metrics. These approaches do not address the root cause, which is that visible false positives in one category can undermine confidence in accurate categories.

It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. Production logs show that when customers describe several related problems in one message, the agent often gives a detailed answer for the first issue, misses later issues, and sometimes recommends a refund without reconciling other charges on the same account. The workflow is predictable: each order or charge must be assessed, then the overall account resolution must be checked before the customer receives a response. What design should you use?
Ask one agent to process the entire case in a single prompt with stricter instructions to be exhaustive.
Explanation
A single broad prompt is the pattern already producing missed issues and inconsistent recommendations. Stricter wording may help slightly, but it does not solve attention dilution across multiple records and concerns.
Correct answer
Use a prompt chain that reviews each order or charge independently, then runs a final account-level consistency pass.
Explanation
This matches a predictable multi-step workflow where each local item needs focused attention before a broader synthesis step. Separating per-item review from account-level reconciliation reduces attention dilution while still catching interactions across issues before responding.
Route the case through every available MCP tool in a fixed sequence before allowing any customer response.
Explanation
Calling every tool creates unnecessary work and may invoke tools that are irrelevant or inappropriate for the case. The problem is not lack of tool execution, it is how the reasoning work is decomposed and reconciled.
Set a maximum of three agent iterations, escalating cases that still contain unresolved issues after the cap.
Explanation
An arbitrary iteration cap is an anti-pattern because it treats symptoms rather than improving task decomposition. It may escalate solvable cases prematurely and still miss issues within cases that finish under the cap.
Overall explanation
Prompt chaining is appropriate when the workflow is predictable and benefits from focused sequential passes. In this case, reviewing each order or charge independently preserves local detail, while a final account-level consistency pass catches interactions such as duplicate charges, refund conflicts, or contradictory resolutions.

The underlying tradeoff is between one broad reasoning pass and structured decomposition. A single prompt with stronger wording still leaves the model juggling too many concerns at once, which can cause attention dilution and inconsistent coverage. Running every MCP tool in a fixed sequence confuses tool execution with reasoning decomposition and can create unnecessary or unsafe operations.

An arbitrary iteration cap is also a reliability anti-pattern because it uses a generic limit as the primary control mechanism rather than structuring the work so the agent can complete it accurately. For predictable workflows, use a fixed sequence of focused reasoning passes, then synthesize. For open-ended investigations, dynamic adaptive decomposition is often more appropriate.

It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. Production logs show simple requests like "Can you resend my tracking link?" take nearly as long as multi-issue cases because every request runs through all specialist subagents. The extra passes sometimes introduce irrelevant refund or policy details into final responses, even when no refund is requested. Complex cases still require multiple specialists and a unified customer-facing answer. What change best improves the orchestration design?
Keep the fixed specialist sequence, but lower each subagent's max_tokens so simple requests complete with less overhead.
Explanation
Reducing token budgets does not fix the orchestration problem of invoking irrelevant subagents for every request. It may also degrade subagent output quality, especially for complex cases that genuinely require detailed investigation.
Route each request to a single keyword-matched specialist, bypassing aggregation unless the customer explicitly asks about multiple issues.
Explanation
Keyword routing is brittle for high-ambiguity support requests and can miss implied or compound issues. Bypassing aggregation also fails when a request looks simple initially but requires multiple backend checks or policy considerations.
Correct answer
Have the coordinator assess request scope, delegate only to relevant specialist subagents, then aggregate their findings into one response.
Explanation
The coordinator should own task decomposition, delegation, result aggregation, and decisions about which subagents are needed for each request. This reduces unnecessary work for simple cases while preserving multi-specialist handling for complex customer issues.
Let specialist subagents message each other directly, allowing whichever agent finishes first to assemble the final customer response.
Explanation
Direct subagent-to-subagent communication weakens observability, controlled information flow, and consistent error handling. In a coordinator-subagent pattern, the coordinator should manage routing and synthesis rather than letting specialists independently decide final ownership.
Overall explanation
Coordinator-owned orchestration is the appropriate pattern when requests vary in complexity. The coordinator should analyze the customer request, decide which specialist subagents are necessary, delegate work, and aggregate findings into a coherent final response.

This design balances efficiency and coverage: simple tracking requests avoid unnecessary refund or policy analysis, while complex billing, return, or account issues can still involve multiple specialists. Lowering max_tokens only reduces response length and risks lower-quality reasoning without addressing unnecessary delegation.

Allowing subagents to communicate directly is an anti-pattern for this architecture because it removes the coordinator's role in observability, error handling, and controlled result synthesis. Keyword-matched single-agent routing is also brittle because customer support requests often contain ambiguity, implied needs, or multiple concerns that require aggregation.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. During refund testing, four backend failure modes are collapsed into the same MCP tool result: payment-service timeout, malformed refund_amount from the agent, an order outside the return window, and the tool account lacking refund permissions. Production simulations show the agent gives the same apology for all failures, retries cases that cannot succeed, and hides access problems as policy denials. What change would most improve the tool contract?
Treat all refund failures as non-retryable business denials, then have the agent explain return policy to customers.
Explanation
This preserves the current problem by collapsing different causes into one business-rule explanation. It would incorrectly describe permission failures and transient outages as customer-facing policy denials, which prevents useful recovery and damages trust.
Retry every failed refund call three times before escalating, regardless of whether the backend reported policy or permission issues.
Explanation
Arbitrary retries are useful only for truly transient failures, not for policy violations, validation errors, or missing permissions. Retrying every failure wastes time, can create duplicate operational load, and delays the correct customer response or escalation.
Correct answer
Return distinct structured categories for transient, validation, business, and permission failures, with retryability flags and customer-safe recovery guidance.
Explanation
This gives the agent enough machine-readable context to select the right recovery path for each failure type. Timeouts can be retried, malformed inputs can be corrected or clarified, policy denials can be explained, and permission failures can be escalated internally without misinforming customers.
Configure the agent to parse backend error strings for keywords, choosing retries, clarifications, or escalation from matched phrases.
Explanation
Parsing natural-language error strings is brittle because wording changes, localization, and backend formatting differences can break routing. The tool contract should expose structured metadata directly rather than forcing the agent to infer categories from prose.
Overall explanation
Structured error responses let an agent distinguish failures that require different recovery behavior. A refund timeout may be retried, a malformed amount should prompt input correction, an outside-window denial should be communicated as a business-rule outcome, and a permission failure should be routed through internal escalation or operational remediation.

The key principle is that MCP tools should not collapse operationally different failures into a generic message. Returning machine-readable fields such as isError, errorCategory, and isRetryable, plus a customer-safe description, allows Claude to reason about the next step without guessing from ambiguous text.

Treating every failure as a business denial misleads customers and hides system access problems. Parsing backend prose for keywords is a brittle anti-pattern, and retrying every failure confuses transient errors with deterministic failures such as policy violations or authorization problems.

Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. Your CI workflow lets Claude Code generate fixes for failing checks, then immediately review the resulting pull request in the same continuing conversation. Audits show the review often overlooks defects tied to assumptions made during implementation, such as trusting a helper API it introduced without validating edge cases. The review prompt already has explicit severity criteria and a consistent finding format. What change would most improve defect detection?
Correct answer
Run the review as a separate Claude Code invocation using only the diff, repository context, and review criteria.
Explanation
A separate review invocation avoids carrying forward the implementation reasoning that may make the model less likely to question its own choices. Providing the diff, repository context, and review criteria preserves the information needed for review without preserving the generator's assumptions.
Run multiple reviews in the original session and require the same finding to appear twice before reporting.
Explanation
Repeating review in the same session tends to preserve the same contextual bias rather than creating a genuinely fresh evaluation. Requiring duplicate findings can also suppress real issues that are detected only once, increasing false negatives.
Ask the generation session to explain its implementation rationale before reviewing the pull request for defects.
Explanation
Having the same session explain its rationale can reinforce the assumptions behind the generated code. This may be useful documentation for humans, but it does not address the reviewer's tendency to accept prior decisions from the same context.
Add stricter instructions telling the same session to challenge assumptions and search aggressively for mistakes.
Explanation
Stricter instructions can improve review behavior, but they still operate inside the same conversation context that contains the model's implementation reasoning. When the failure mode is self-review bias, prompt wording alone is a weaker control than isolating the review context.
Overall explanation
Independent review context is the key design choice when Claude generates code and then reviews that same code. A model that retains the reasoning context from implementation may be less likely to question the decisions it just made, especially when defects are tied to implicit assumptions from generation.

Running review as a separate Claude Code invocation gives the reviewer the artifacts it needs, such as the diff, relevant repository context, and review criteria, without inheriting the generator's rationale. This preserves review quality while reducing self-review bias.

Asking the same session for rationale or adding stronger instructions can be helpful in some workflows, but they remain probabilistic mitigations inside the biased context. Repeating reviews in the original session and requiring consensus is an anti-pattern because it can keep the same blind spots while filtering out valid single-pass findings.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. A debugging session named "refund-escalation-tuning" previously inspected the support agent's system prompt, refund policy file, process_refund tool schema, and production traces. Before you continue, a teammate changed only the refund policy file and the process_refund tool schema. You want to keep useful prior analysis without letting outdated assumptions drive the next changes. What should you do?
Use the previous plan unchanged because Claude already inspected relevant files and session history preserves that earlier analysis.
Explanation
Session history preserves what Claude saw earlier, but it does not automatically update old observations after files change. Proceeding with the old plan risks implementing fixes based on obsolete policy language or an outdated tool schema.
Correct answer
Resume the named session, identify the changed policy and tool-schema files, and request targeted revalidation before implementing fixes.
Explanation
This preserves the useful investigation context while explicitly correcting the parts most likely to be stale. By naming the changed artifacts and asking for targeted revalidation, Claude can refresh affected assumptions without repeating the entire discovery process.
Resume the session, ask Claude for a single confidence score, and proceed when the score is above threshold.
Explanation
A self-reported confidence score is not a reliable substitute for refreshing stale evidence. The agent needs concrete updated context and revalidation of affected conclusions, not a subjective threshold over prior analysis.
Start a new session and have Claude rediscover the entire repository before considering any prior conclusions or proposed fixes.
Explanation
Starting fresh is useful when most prior context is stale or polluted, but the situation states that only two artifacts changed. Full rediscovery wastes time and context, and it may discard valuable findings from the earlier investigation.
Overall explanation
Session resumption is most effective when prior context is still mostly valid but some known inputs have changed. In that case, resume the named session and explicitly provide the changed artifacts, such as the updated policy file and tool schema, so Claude can re-check only the affected assumptions before continuing.

The key tradeoff is between preserving accumulated context and avoiding stale conclusions. Starting from scratch is appropriate when prior tool results or analysis are broadly unreliable, but it is inefficient when the changes are narrow and well understood.

Continuing with the old plan unchanged is an anti-pattern because resumed sessions do not automatically know that previously inspected files have changed. Similarly, asking for a confidence score does not validate the underlying facts and can create false assurance.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. After verified customer, order, and policy facts are already collected for a difficult billing dispute, two plausible resolution paths remain. In previous tests, exploring both paths in one conversation caused later analysis to inherit assumptions from earlier analysis, while starting from scratch created inconsistent fact bases and extra backend calls. What is the best way to compare the two paths?
Resume the same named session twice, ask Claude to ignore the other path, then merge both final answers.
Explanation
Resuming the same session does not create independent reasoning branches. Asking Claude to ignore prior context is a prompt-based workaround and does not reliably prevent assumptions from one path influencing the other.
Start two fresh sessions, rerun all customer and order lookups separately, then compare their independent recommendations.
Explanation
Fresh sessions reduce cross-contamination, but they discard the already validated baseline and duplicate backend work. They also risk producing different fact sets if tool results, summaries, or retrieval timing differ between sessions.
Correct answer
Use fork_session from the verified case baseline, explore each resolution path independently, then compare branch summaries before deciding.
Explanation
This preserves the shared factual baseline while isolating divergent reasoning paths from each other. It avoids both context contamination from a single conversation and inconsistent facts from independently restarted investigations.
Explore both paths in one conversation, separating them with headings and stopping after three turns each.
Explanation
Headings do not isolate session context, so assumptions from one path can still affect the other. An arbitrary turn cap is an anti-pattern because it controls exploration length rather than reasoning quality or completion state.
Overall explanation
Forking is the right session-management pattern when you need to explore divergent approaches from a shared analysis baseline. Using fork_session lets each branch inherit the verified customer, order, and policy facts, while keeping subsequent reasoning isolated.

The underlying principle is to separate shared factual state from branch-specific reasoning. This avoids the contamination risk of analyzing conflicting strategies in one conversation, and it avoids the inconsistency and extra tool usage caused by starting completely fresh sessions.

Resuming the same named session is useful when prior context remains valid, but it does not create independent branches. Prompting Claude to ignore earlier analysis, relying on headings, or imposing arbitrary turn limits are weak substitutes for actual context isolation.

Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. Your automated pull request reviewer often flags issues such as "possible confusing naming" and "maybe incomplete validation" that developers dismiss as speculative. The current prompt already says "be conservative" and "only report high-confidence findings," but dismissal rates have not improved across three sprints. What prompt change is most likely to improve precision without eliminating useful findings?
Run the same broad prompt three times and report only findings appearing in at least two runs.
Explanation
Majority voting over repeated broad reviews increases cost and latency without addressing the prompt's unclear decision boundaries. Real issues may appear inconsistently, and repeated vague prompts can still converge on the same false positives.
Increase the required confidence threshold to 95%, requiring Claude to suppress any finding unless it can justify near certainty.
Explanation
Self-reported confidence thresholds are poorly calibrated and do not reliably map to actual correctness. This can still allow confident false positives while suppressing useful findings that require nuanced judgment.
Add "be extremely conservative" twice in the system prompt, placing it before and after the review checklist.
Explanation
Repeating vague instructions is an anti-pattern because it emphasizes caution without defining what caution means. The reviewer still lacks concrete criteria for distinguishing reportable defects from speculative concerns.
Correct answer
Replace vague confidence guidance with concrete reportable and non-reportable categories, severity definitions, and code examples for each finding type.
Explanation
General phrases like "be conservative" do not give Claude operational boundaries for deciding what to report. Concrete categories, severity criteria, and examples give the reviewer a repeatable decision framework that reduces speculative findings while preserving actionable ones.
Overall explanation
Specific criteria improve precision because they translate review judgment into observable decision rules, such as which categories are reportable, which should be skipped, and how severity should be assigned. In practice, prompts that define concrete examples for bugs, security issues, validation gaps, and non-reportable style concerns give Claude a clearer basis for deciding what belongs in PR feedback.

Vague instructions like "be conservative" or "only report high-confidence findings" are weak controls because they do not define the boundary between actionable and speculative feedback. Confidence thresholds are also unreliable when they depend on the model's own calibration rather than external validation or explicit criteria.

Repeating broad caution language and majority voting over repeated broad prompts are anti-patterns for this problem. They may change how often Claude reports findings, but they do not fix the underlying ambiguity that caused developers to dismiss speculative issues.

Scenario: Code Generation with Claude Code You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. Your repository has separate frontend, backend, and data packages. Each package has a maintainer-owned standards document that changes monthly, and Claude Code currently receives a copied, 900-line root instruction file covering every package. Developers report inconsistent behavior because irrelevant conventions appear in context, and standards drift when copied sections are not updated. What is the most maintainable configuration change?
Move package standards into each developer's ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md so individual users can customize package guidance locally.
Explanation
User-level CLAUDE.md files are not shared through the repository, so this would create inconsistent team behavior. It also puts package standards in personal configuration rather than in version-controlled project context.
Keep all standards in the root CLAUDE.md, adding stronger headings that tell Claude to ignore unrelated package sections.
Explanation
This preserves the monolithic file that is already causing irrelevant context to appear in sessions. Stronger headings may help somewhat, but they do not solve instruction bloat or standards drift across copied sections.
Correct answer
Use small package-level CLAUDE.md files that reference the relevant standards documents with @import, keeping shared root guidance minimal.
Explanation
This keeps package-specific guidance close to the code while avoiding copied instruction drift. The @import pattern lets maintainers keep canonical standards in separate files and load only the relevant content through each package's CLAUDE.md.
Duplicate the current standards into every package subdirectory CLAUDE.md, and assign maintainers to update copied sections manually.
Explanation
Duplicating standards across many files creates the same drift problem in more locations. Manual synchronization is an anti-pattern when a canonical standards file can be referenced instead.
Overall explanation
Modular CLAUDE.md organization is the right fit when teams already maintain canonical standards documents and need different packages to load different guidance. Small package-level CLAUDE.md files can use @import to reference the relevant standards files, keeping instructions version-controlled, maintainable, and scoped to the package context.

The underlying tradeoff is between centralized maintainability and context relevance. A single large root file is easy to find, but it increases irrelevant context and relies on Claude to choose the right sections. Copying standards into many directories worsens maintenance drift because every standards change requires synchronized edits.

User-level memory is inappropriate for team package standards because ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md applies only to one developer and is not shared through version control. For shared engineering conventions, keep the configuration in the repository and use imports or scoped project files intentionally.

Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Your nightly run submits 30,000 document extraction requests. The result processing job must update the correct downstream record for each successful extraction and resubmit only the documents that failed validation or exceeded context limits. During testing, engineers notice that relying on the result file's line order creates occasional mismatches after retries and partial failure handling. What design should you use?
Submit one combined request containing all documents, so every extraction and failure appears in a single ordered output.
Explanation
Combining all documents into one request reduces failure isolation and can create context and validation problems for large extraction workloads. It also makes it harder to resubmit only failed documents and does not provide reliable per-document reconciliation metadata.
Assume batch results preserve submission order, then join each response to the original manifest by its array position.
Explanation
Joining by array position is brittle because batch processing and retry workflows should not depend on positional assumptions. Once failed documents are resubmitted or manifests are filtered, array positions can diverge from the original document set and corrupt downstream records.
Correct answer
Assign a stable custom_id derived from each document record, persist it with request metadata, and reconcile results using that identifier.
Explanation
Message Batches are designed to support request and response correlation through custom_id values. Persisting a stable identifier with the submitted request lets the ingestion job map successes and failures back to the correct document, even when responses are processed after retries or partial failures.
Ask Claude to include the source filename in every extraction, then parse that field when processing failures.
Explanation
This makes correlation depend on model-generated content, which is an anti-pattern for production batch reconciliation. Failed requests may not contain a valid extraction at all, and even successful outputs could contain normalized, missing, or ambiguous filenames.
Overall explanation
Batch correlation should be based on stable request metadata, not output ordering or model-generated text. The Message Batches API supports custom_id so each request can be matched to its result, allowing downstream systems to update the correct record and resubmit only failed items.

The underlying tradeoff is operational reliability versus convenience. Array-position joins may appear simple, but they become fragile when batches are retried, filtered, or partially reprocessed. Parsing filenames from Claude's extraction output is also unreliable because correlation should not depend on generated content, especially for failed responses.

Combining many documents into one request is usually the wrong direction for batch extraction because it weakens per-document failure handling and can create unnecessary context pressure. A stable custom_id per document or chunk preserves traceability across asynchronous processing, validation, and selective resubmission workflows.

Scenario: Code Generation with Claude Code You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. A developer asks Claude Code to replace a legacy logging library across 18 packages. There are two viable migration paths, several unknown wrapper modules, and likely mechanical edits after the team chooses one approach. What workflow best balances careful discovery with efficient implementation?
Use direct execution from the start, letting compile errors reveal hidden wrappers and adjusting the migration strategy afterward.
Explanation
This is an anti-pattern for work with multiple viable approaches and unknown dependencies. It turns discovery into trial-and-error implementation, increasing the risk of broad rework across many packages.
Remain in plan mode for the entire task, requiring Claude to re-plan after every package-level edit before continuing.
Explanation
Plan mode is valuable for exploration and design, but using it for every mechanical edit adds unnecessary overhead once the approach is chosen. The stated situation says implementation should become mechanical after the team selects a path.
Correct answer
Use plan mode to investigate dependencies and choose the migration path, then switch to direct execution for the agreed edits.
Explanation
This separates the uncertain discovery and design phase from the clearer implementation phase. Plan mode reduces costly rework while the architecture is still undecided, and direct execution is efficient once the migration path and edit sequence are known.
Split the task into separate direct-execution sessions per package, avoiding shared context so each migration stays locally focused.
Explanation
Package-level isolation can miss cross-package abstractions, shared wrappers, and consistency requirements. The problem explicitly involves unknown shared modules, so avoiding shared context undermines the needed architectural understanding.
Overall explanation
Best practice: Use Claude Code plan mode for the uncertain portion of a task, such as dependency discovery, comparing migration paths, and selecting an approach. Once the team has reviewed and accepted a clear plan, switching to direct execution lets Claude apply the known changes efficiently.

The underlying tradeoff is between safe exploration and implementation throughput. Plan mode is designed for complex tasks with architectural decisions or multiple valid approaches, while direct execution is appropriate when the scope and steps are well understood.

Starting directly and relying on compile errors to reveal architecture is a trial-and-error anti-pattern that can create avoidable rework. Staying in plan mode for every mechanical edit wastes time after the uncertainty has been resolved, and isolating each package in separate sessions risks missing shared abstractions.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. During testing, a customer says they were charged twice and want a refund. The first model response contains a brief customer-facing sentence plus a request to call get_customer, but your loop displays the sentence and exits, so no tool runs. After a later patch, some conversations continue calling tools even after Claude has produced a complete customer response. Which implementation change best addresses both failure modes?
Correct answer
Drive the loop from stop_reason, execute requested tools when it is tool_use, and return only when it is end_turn.
Explanation
The loop should use the response metadata that indicates whether Claude is requesting tool execution or finishing the turn. This prevents premature exit when a response contains both text and tool calls, and prevents unnecessary continuation after Claude has completed the answer.
Predefine a fixed get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund sequence, stopping whenever a backend tool returns a successful response.
Explanation
A fixed tool sequence removes Claude's ability to decide which tool is needed based on the customer’s actual issue. Stopping after any successful tool result is also unsafe because the model still needs to interpret the result and decide whether more action or a final response is required.
Run at most three iterations for every request, returning the latest assistant text once the cap is reached.
Explanation
An arbitrary iteration cap is not a reliable primary termination condition. Some simple cases may need fewer turns, while legitimate multi-tool support cases may need more, so the cap can either waste work or truncate valid workflows.
Stop the loop when the assistant text includes final answer language, then skip any remaining tool_use blocks.
Explanation
Parsing natural language for completion is unreliable because assistant text can appear before or alongside tool requests. Skipping tool_use blocks would cause the system to ignore actions Claude explicitly requested, producing incomplete or incorrect support outcomes.
Overall explanation
Correct loop control uses Claude's response metadata rather than surface text. In an agentic loop, the application sends the conversation to Claude, checks stop_reason, executes tool calls when the value is tool_use, appends the corresponding tool results to the conversation, and continues until Claude returns end_turn.

This works because assistant text is not a reliable completion signal. Claude may include a short explanatory sentence before requesting a tool, so stopping on text would skip required backend actions such as customer lookup. Conversely, continuing after end_turn can cause unnecessary tool calls or repeated work after Claude has already produced the final customer response.

The anti-patterns are using natural-language phrases as loop signals, treating an arbitrary iteration cap as the main stopping rule, or replacing model-driven tool choice with a rigid tool chain. Iteration limits can still be useful as safety guards, but they should not be the primary mechanism for normal loop termination.

The underlying principle is to let Claude reason about the next action while the application provides deterministic control flow around tool execution. Learn more in Tool Use and the Agent SDK documentation.

Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. Your CI review recently started producing noisy feedback after you added a database migration checklist to shared instructions. Pull requests that only modify TypeScript handlers now receive warnings about lock duration and rollback scripts, but SQL migration pull requests still need those checks. Migration files appear under both <code>services/*/db/migrations/*.sql</code> and <code>packages/*/migrations/*.sql</code>. You want the guidance to apply automatically during review only when those files are edited, without adding CI path-routing logic. What should you do?
Duplicate migration instructions into every service and package directory CLAUDE.md so nearby files inherit local conventions.
Explanation
Directory-level files can help with localized conventions, but duplicating the same checklist across many locations is brittle and harder to maintain. It also does not express a single file-type rule spanning multiple directory patterns as cleanly as path-scoped rules.
Correct answer
Create a focused rule file with YAML frontmatter paths for both migration globs, containing only the migration review checklist.
Explanation
This uses path-scoped rule activation so the migration checklist is loaded only when Claude Code is working on matching migration files. It avoids irrelevant context for TypeScript-only reviews while preserving automatic behavior in CI.
Create a project slash command for migration reviews and make CI select it when SQL files appear.
Explanation
A slash command can package a workflow, but this adds CI routing logic that the situation explicitly wants to avoid. It also shifts conditional loading from Claude Code configuration into pipeline scripting, increasing maintenance complexity.
Move the migration checklist into the root CLAUDE.md and add instructions telling Claude to ignore unrelated sections.
Explanation
Root CLAUDE.md content is broadly loaded as project context, so the migration checklist can still influence unrelated reviews. Telling Claude to ignore irrelevant sections is a prompt-based filtering anti-pattern when file-path scoping can remove the irrelevant guidance entirely.
Overall explanation
The best approach is to use a path-scoped rule in .claude/rules/ with YAML frontmatter containing a paths field for the migration file globs. This lets Claude Code automatically load the migration checklist only when matching files are involved, reducing irrelevant context and false positives during CI reviews.

The underlying principle is conditional convention loading: guidance should be available when it is relevant, but absent when it would distract the model or bias findings. A root CLAUDE.md checklist remains broadly available and relies on Claude to ignore irrelevant material, which is less reliable than not loading it in the first place.

Duplicating directory-level instructions across many packages creates drift and maintenance overhead. A slash command can be useful for manually invoked workflows, but it requires external path-routing behavior when the requirement is automatic configuration-based loading.

It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. Production reviews show inconsistent tool choices when customers use colloquial requests such as "I was charged twice," "where is my replacement," and "I want my money back." The agent sometimes calls process_refund before confirming refund eligibility, uses lookup_order with emails that only get_customer accepts, and escalates duplicate-name matches without asking for order details. What is the most effective tool-interface change to improve selection reliability without hard-coding a decision tree?
Merge support tools into one execute_support_action tool that accepts freeform intent, identifiers, and requested outcome fields.
Explanation
A broad freeform tool hides important operational boundaries from the model instead of clarifying them. It also makes it harder to enforce different input requirements and safety constraints for customer lookup, order lookup, refunds, and escalation.
Add a keyword router that maps phrases like "money back" and "charged twice" directly to specific tools.
Explanation
Keyword routing is brittle because customer language is varied and context-dependent. It can create unsafe associations, such as treating any mention of money back as authorization to call a refund tool before eligibility is established.
Instruct the agent to try get_customer, lookup_order, then process_refund in that fixed sequence for every request.
Explanation
A fixed sequence ignores the actual user request and can cause unnecessary or inappropriate tool calls. It replaces model-driven tool selection with a rigid workflow that is especially risky because not every support case should reach refund processing.
Correct answer
Revise each tool description to state accepted identifiers, example customer phrases, edge cases, and boundaries versus similar tools.
Explanation
This directly improves the information Claude uses to choose among tools in ambiguous support conversations. Including accepted inputs, representative examples, edge cases, and boundaries helps the model distinguish when to retrieve customer records, inspect orders, refund, or escalate.
Overall explanation
Effective tool descriptions should explain what each tool does, what inputs it accepts, what it returns, and when to use it instead of nearby alternatives. In this case, adding accepted identifier formats, example customer phrases, edge cases such as duplicate matches, and clear boundaries between customer lookup, order lookup, refund processing, and escalation gives Claude the context needed for reliable tool selection.

The underlying principle is that tool interfaces are part of the agent's reasoning environment. When tool boundaries are vague, the model must infer behavior from names alone, which leads to misrouting in high-ambiguity support requests. Good descriptions preserve model-driven flexibility while reducing avoidable ambiguity.

Keyword routing is an anti-pattern because natural language support requests rarely map cleanly to single words or phrases. Consolidating distinct operations into one freeform action tool removes useful boundaries, while forcing the same tool sequence for every request creates unnecessary calls and can trigger unsafe operations.

Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. Reviewers receive structured QA findings about extracted contract fields before downstream loading. After two weeks, audits show that most categories are useful, but findings labeled "ambiguous payment terms" are dismissed in 68% of reviews because the source wording is often acceptable. Reviewers have started ignoring the entire QA feed, including accurate findings about unsupported totals and missing effective dates. What should you do next?
Keep all finding categories active and ask reviewers to dismiss incorrect items until enough data accumulates.
Explanation
Continuing to show a high-noise category worsens alert fatigue and further undermines trust in the QA feed. More dismissal data may be useful later, but it should not come at the cost of reviewers ignoring accurate categories.
Correct answer
Temporarily suppress the ambiguous payment terms category while refining its criteria and examples before re-enabling it.
Explanation
This targets the specific category damaging reviewer trust without weakening categories that are already useful. Temporarily removing the noisy category preserves trust in accurate findings while giving the team time to improve the prompt criteria and examples.
Raise the global confidence threshold for all QA findings until the overall volume drops to an acceptable level.
Explanation
A global threshold treats all finding categories as equally unreliable, even though the evidence shows only one category is causing most dismissals. It may hide accurate findings about missing dates and unsupported totals while failing to fix the unclear decision boundary.
Add a general instruction telling Claude to be conservative and report only findings it is highly confident about.
Explanation
Vague instructions like being conservative or high confidence are less effective than category-specific criteria. This does not clarify what makes payment term wording reportable versus acceptable, so the same false positives are likely to continue.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: When one finding category has a high false positive rate and is damaging trust in otherwise useful QA output, temporarily suppressing that category is the pragmatic next step. This preserves reviewer attention for categories that are already reliable while the team improves the problematic category with clearer criteria and targeted examples.

Underlying principle: Precision matters because high false positive categories can contaminate user trust in the entire system. Prompt engineering should define concrete reportable and non-reportable conditions, not rely on vague concepts like confidence or conservatism.

Why the distractors fail: Raising a global threshold can reduce useful findings across all categories, including accurate ones. A broad instruction to be conservative is an anti-pattern because it does not specify the decision boundary. Leaving the noisy category active creates alert fatigue and teaches reviewers to ignore the system.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. Production traces show that when customers provide photos and an order number, the agent sometimes calls process_refund immediately after get_customer succeeds, before lookup_order confirms item status, purchase date, and refundable amount. Several refunds were issued for final-sale items that backend policy would have rejected. What change would most effectively prevent this failure while preserving autonomous resolution for eligible cases?
Strengthen the system prompt to state that process_refund may run only after checking customer identity and order eligibility.
Explanation
Prompt instructions can improve behavior, but they do not guarantee compliance for financial operations. The production failures show that probabilistic adherence is not reliable enough when an invalid refund can be issued.
Require the agent to search its prior assistant text for 'eligible refund' before allowing process_refund calls.
Explanation
Parsing natural-language assistant text is an anti-pattern because wording can vary and may not reflect verified backend state. Eligibility should be based on structured tool results, not on whether a phrase appears in generated text.
Escalate every refund request involving photos or final-sale keywords to humans before any backend tools run.
Explanation
This would prevent some bad refunds, but it is overly broad and sacrifices autonomous resolution for cases the agent could handle safely. Keyword-triggered escalation can also misclassify straightforward cases and does not address the underlying tool-ordering failure.
Correct answer
Add a tool-call gate that rejects process_refund until get_customer and lookup_order return matching, refund-eligible records.
Explanation
This creates deterministic enforcement for a business-critical workflow step rather than relying on the model to remember the sequence. It still allows autonomous refunds when the required backend facts prove eligibility, preserving first-contact resolution for valid cases.
Overall explanation
Deterministic workflow enforcement is the right approach when a downstream action, such as process_refund, depends on verified prerequisite facts from backend tools. A tool-call gate can block the refund action until get_customer and lookup_order provide matching customer, order, eligibility, and amount data.

The key tradeoff is between preserving autonomy and preventing irreversible business errors. A gate allows the agent to continue resolving eligible refund cases without human involvement, while making policy-violating tool sequences impossible.

Prompt reminders and few-shot patterns are useful guidance, but they remain probabilistic and are insufficient for financial operations that require guaranteed ordering. Parsing assistant text for phrases like eligible refund is especially fragile because generated language is not a reliable source of truth. Escalating broad categories based on keywords may reduce risk, but it damages first-contact resolution and still avoids the real architectural issue.

Specific review criteria align the review with the categories that matter in CI and reduce subjective comments. By defining what to report and what to skip, the prompt improves precision and preserves developer trust in important findings.
Instruct Claude to report only findings it rates above 8/10 confidence, while keeping the same broad review scope.
Explanation
Self-reported confidence is not a reliable proxy for whether a finding is useful or actionable. Keeping the broad scope means the review can still produce confident but low-value style and preference comments.
Ask Claude to include every possible improvement, then rely on developers to triage severity labels during pull request review.
Explanation
This increases reviewer burden and worsens the signal-to-noise problem that caused developers to ignore the bot. Severity labels do not compensate for reporting subjective or non-actionable issues in the first place.
Limit each review to five comments sorted by severity, leaving the existing broad issue categories otherwise unchanged.
Explanation
An arbitrary comment cap reduces volume but does not improve the model's decision boundary for what deserves reporting. It can also hide important findings if low-value issues consume the limited slots.
Overall explanation
Specific review criteria are the right first change when automated CI reviews produce too many subjective or low-value comments. The prompt should define the categories worth reporting, such as demonstrable correctness bugs, security risks, and meaningful test gaps, and also define categories to skip, such as stylistic preferences without documented project impact.

The underlying principle is that precision improves when Claude has concrete reportability rules, not vague instructions to be conservative or confident. Confidence thresholds are an anti-pattern here because self-reported confidence can be poorly calibrated, especially for subjective code review judgments.

Arbitrary comment limits and severity-only triage reduce visible volume without fixing the underlying selection criteria. Asking for every possible improvement makes the review less useful by shifting filtering work to developers and undermining trust in the automated reviewer.

Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. Your pull request review workflow exposes two structured tools: extract_pr_metadata and generate_review_findings. Recent CI logs show that on documentation-heavy pull requests, Claude sometimes calls generate_review_findings first, so findings lack required repository area, file ownership, and review policy metadata. The metadata must be captured before later review and enrichment steps run. What change best improves reliability?
Set tool_choice to any and place extract_pr_metadata first, allowing Claude to choose the best structured tool.
Explanation
The any setting guarantees that Claude calls a tool, but it does not guarantee which tool is selected. Listing the metadata tool first may influence behavior, but it does not enforce the required ordering.
Keep tool_choice as auto and strengthen the prompt to always complete metadata extraction before generating findings.
Explanation
The auto setting allows Claude to return text or choose a tool based on its judgment, so it cannot guarantee the required first step. Stronger prompting may reduce failures, but it remains probabilistic and is not reliable enough for a deterministic CI workflow dependency.
Correct answer
Configure tool_choice to force extract_pr_metadata on the first request, then run review findings in a follow-up turn.
Explanation
Forced tool selection is the right mechanism when a specific structured extraction must happen before later steps. It guarantees that the first model response is a call to the metadata tool, after which the pipeline can use the result in a follow-up request for findings generation.
Gate the loop by parsing assistant text for 'metadata complete' before accepting generated review findings.
Explanation
Parsing natural language status phrases is a brittle anti-pattern because phrasing can vary and may not reflect actual structured state. The pipeline should rely on tool calls and structured tool results, not assistant text, to determine workflow progress.
Overall explanation
Forced tool selection is appropriate when the workflow requires one specific structured step before later processing. By setting tool_choice to a forced tool such as {"type":"tool","name":"extract_pr_metadata"}, the first request reliably produces the required metadata extraction rather than leaving the model to choose among available tools.

The architectural principle is that structured pipelines should make deterministic dependencies explicit. After the metadata tool call returns, the CI system can send a follow-up request that includes the metadata and allows the review findings step to run with the necessary context.

tool_choice: "any" only ensures that some tool is called, not that the correct tool is called first. tool_choice: "auto" is even less constrained because Claude may return conversational text instead of a tool call. Parsing phrases like metadata complete is a brittle anti-pattern because control flow should depend on structured tool use events and results, not natural language text.

Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. A senior engineer created a /pr-feedback workflow that applies your team's review checklist and suppresses known false-positive categories. It works on their laptop, but clean CI runners and new contributors report "command not found" unless they manually copy files from that engineer's home directory. You want the same command to be available from a fresh repository checkout and reviewed alongside workflow changes. What should you do?
Keep the command in ~/.claude/commands/ and add onboarding instructions for each developer and runner to copy it.
Explanation
The ~/.claude/commands/ location is user-scoped, so it is appropriate for personal commands rather than team-wide automation. Requiring manual copying is fragile and will keep causing drift across developers and CI runners.
Correct answer
Store the command markdown under .claude/commands/ in the repository, then commit it with the CI workflow changes.
Explanation
Project-scoped commands in .claude/commands/ are shared through version control, so they are available from a fresh checkout. Committing the command with the workflow also makes review criteria changes visible in code review, which supports consistent CI behavior.
Embed the review checklist directly in each workflow step so every pipeline job constructs its own prompt.
Explanation
Duplicating the checklist inside workflow steps may make CI run, but it does not create a reusable command for developers. It also increases maintenance cost and creates a drift risk when review guidance changes.
Move the checklist into CLAUDE.md and instruct reviewers to type the same prompt whenever CI needs review.
Explanation
CLAUDE.md provides persistent project context and instructions, but it does not define an invokable slash command. This also introduces a manual prompt-copying step, which is unreliable for repeatable CI workflows.
Overall explanation
Project-scoped custom commands belong in .claude/commands/ when a team needs a reusable slash command to travel with the repository. This makes the command available after a fresh checkout and ensures changes to review behavior are visible in normal code review.

User-scoped commands in ~/.claude/commands/ are useful for personal workflows, experiments, or local preferences, but they are the wrong scope for CI and shared team processes. Manually copying files from a developer's home directory is an anti-pattern because it creates hidden dependencies and configuration drift.

CLAUDE.md is useful for always-loaded project context, such as coding standards or review criteria, but it is not a replacement for a slash command definition. Embedding the same checklist directly in multiple CI workflow steps can work superficially, but it duplicates logic and fails to provide the same command to developers.

The underlying principle is to choose the scope that matches the collaboration boundary: repository-scoped artifacts for team automation, user-scoped artifacts for individual customization. Learn more in the Claude Code Overview and CLAUDE.md Configuration.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. Production logs show inconsistent tool selection for billing-related messages. Routine refund requests are sometimes escalated, while requests requiring policy review are sometimes sent directly to process_refund. There are no backend errors, and the tool registry shows broad descriptions with little detail about side effects, eligible inputs, or boundaries between refund handling and human escalation. What is the best first change to improve reliability?
Merge process_refund and escalate_to_human into one handle_billing_case tool that internally decides the correct backend action.
Explanation
Consolidating tools can sometimes reduce ambiguity, but it also hides important action boundaries and side effects from the model. For financial and escalation workflows, preserving distinct tools with clear descriptions is safer than burying decisions inside a generic tool.
Correct answer
Rewrite the affected tool descriptions to specify purposes, required inputs, side effects, examples, and boundaries between refund and escalation workflows.
Explanation
Tool descriptions are the primary signal Claude uses when deciding which tool fits a user request. Adding clear boundaries, side effects, and examples directly addresses the observed misselection without adding brittle external logic.
Raise temperature slightly so the agent explores alternative tool choices instead of repeatedly choosing the same billing action.
Explanation
Temperature changes randomness, not the model's understanding of tool boundaries. Increasing variability can make production behavior less predictable and does not address the missing selection guidance in the tool interface.
Add a keyword router that sends messages containing refund to process_refund and messages containing supervisor to escalate_to_human.
Explanation
Keyword routing is a brittle anti-pattern for high-ambiguity support requests because user language often does not map cleanly to tool intent. It can also override Claude's ability to reason from the full context, such as policy exceptions or customer preferences.
Overall explanation
Clear tool descriptions are the main interface Claude uses to decide which MCP tool is appropriate for a given request. In this situation, the problem is not backend failure or unavailable tooling, it is unreliable selection among tools whose boundaries are underspecified. Descriptions should explain when to use each tool, required inputs, outputs, side effects, examples, and when a similar tool is more appropriate.

The key architectural principle is that tool interfaces are part of the agent design, not just developer documentation. For tools with business impact, such as process_refund and escalate_to_human, descriptions must make consequences and eligibility criteria explicit so the model can reason correctly before acting.

Keyword routing is a brittle anti-pattern because customer support language is ambiguous and context-dependent. Merging tools into a generic handler can obscure important boundaries, while changing temperature only changes randomness and can reduce reliability. For more guidance, see Tool Use and MCP Tools.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. During a week-long investigation into regressions in billing dispute handling, the coordinator has already explored order lookup flows, refund policy files, and escalation handlers. It then launches subagents to inspect refund calculation and account-status branches. The subagents produce inconsistent findings, miss constraints discovered earlier, and repeat searches that were already completed. What change would most effectively improve reliability across the next exploration phase?
Correct answer
Before launching each new investigation wave, create a structured findings brief and include it in every subagent’s initial prompt.
Explanation
Subagents do not automatically share the coordinator’s accumulated working context, so prior discoveries must be carried forward explicitly. A structured brief gives each new exploration phase the necessary baseline, reducing repeated searches and preventing missed constraints from earlier work.
Increase the number of parallel subagents so repeated searches are diluted across more independent codebase exploration branches and files.
Explanation
More parallelism can improve latency for independent questions, but it does not preserve knowledge between exploration phases. Without shared findings injected into each prompt, additional subagents may simply duplicate work faster and amplify inconsistent conclusions.
Set a strict maximum of two tool calls per subagent to force concise exploration and reduce repeated context growth.
Explanation
Arbitrary tool-call caps are an anti-pattern when they become the primary reliability control. They may stop useful investigation before the subagent gathers enough evidence, and they do not address the missing prior context that caused repeated searches.
Keep the full coordinator conversation open longer and rely on subagents to recover earlier discoveries through additional tool searches.
Explanation
A longer coordinator conversation does not solve context isolation for subagents, and it can worsen context degradation. Asking each subagent to rediscover prior findings wastes tool calls and increases the chance that important constraints are found inconsistently or missed entirely.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: In phased codebase exploration, each new wave of subagents needs a reliable baseline of what has already been learned. Creating a structured findings brief and placing it in each subagent’s initial prompt preserves important constraints, file locations, decisions, and open questions across context boundaries.

Underlying principle: Subagents operate with isolated context, so they do not automatically inherit the coordinator’s conversation history or the findings from earlier agents. Reliable orchestration requires explicit context passing, especially when investigations span multiple phases and the codebase is too large to keep every raw tool result in the active conversation.

Why the distractors fail: Keeping a long coordinator conversation open can worsen context degradation and does not give subagents the needed information automatically. Adding more parallel subagents improves throughput only when each agent has the right starting context. Strict tool-call limits are an arbitrary cap that may reduce evidence quality while leaving the actual context handoff problem unresolved.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. In production, escalated cases often bounce back because human support agents ask customers to repeat order numbers, refund amounts, and prior troubleshooting details. The escalation review console shows only fields submitted through the escalate_to_human tool, not the original chat transcript or tool results. What change best improves escalation handoff quality?
Escalate cases earlier whenever sentiment appears negative, so human agents can gather missing details directly from customers.
Explanation
This is incorrect because sentiment is an unreliable proxy for escalation quality or case complexity. It also creates a poor customer experience by pushing information gathering onto the human agent and customer instead of preserving context from the automated workflow.
Attach a transcript link to each escalation and instruct human agents to read it before contacting the customer.
Explanation
This is incorrect because the scenario states that human agents cannot access the original transcript or tool results. Depending on an unavailable transcript link fails to solve the actual handoff constraint.
Send only the final customer-facing response in escalation notes, keeping internal reasoning and tool details out of the handoff.
Explanation
This is incorrect because the final response usually omits the diagnostic details a human agent needs to continue the case. It may be concise for the customer, but it does not preserve verified facts, tool findings, or recommended actions for the reviewer.
Correct answer
Populate escalate_to_human with a structured handoff including customer ID, verified facts, root cause, amounts, attempted actions, and recommended next steps.
Explanation
This is correct because the human agent reviewing the escalation does not have access to the conversation transcript or tool results. A structured handoff preserves the operational context needed to continue the case without forcing the customer to repeat information.
Overall explanation
Structured escalation handoffs are essential when the human reviewer lacks access to the original conversation or tool outputs. The agent should send a compact, explicit payload through escalate_to_human that includes identifiers, verified facts, root cause analysis, requested or calculated amounts, actions already attempted, and a recommended next step.

The underlying principle is that handoff boundaries are context boundaries. If critical context is not passed in a durable structured form, it is effectively lost, and the downstream human must reconstruct the case from the customer.

Sending only the customer-facing response optimizes for brevity but loses operational context. Relying on a transcript link fails when the reviewer cannot access transcripts, and sentiment-triggered escalation is an anti-pattern because it does not preserve facts or improve routing accuracy.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. You added AgentDefinition entries for billing-investigator and returns-investigator specialists, but production traces show the coordinator never starts them. The coordinator is configured with allowedTools containing only get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, and escalate_to_human. What change best enables the intended delegation without unnecessarily broadening each specialist's permissions?
Correct answer
Add Task to coordinator allowedTools and invoke specialists through it, while keeping backend MCP tools scoped to appropriate agents.
Explanation
The coordinator must have the subagent-spawning mechanism available as a tool before it can delegate work. Adding Task to allowedTools enables real subagent invocation while preserving least-privilege tool scoping for the specialists.
Instruct the coordinator to mention specialist names in prompts and treat their natural-language replies as delegated investigations.
Explanation
Naming specialists in prompts does not create or invoke subagents through the Agent SDK. Treating natural-language text as a handoff is an anti-pattern because it bypasses the actual orchestration mechanism and produces unreliable delegation.
Grant every specialist all backend MCP tools so they can self-select capabilities without coordinator-mediated spawning.
Explanation
Giving every specialist all backend tools increases tool-selection complexity and violates role-based scoping. It also does not address the coordinator's inability to start subagents in the first place.
Run separate support-agent sessions for each specialty and paste their final summaries into the coordinator after completion.
Explanation
Manual parallel sessions bypass the coordinator-subagent orchestration model and make state, error handling, and observability harder to manage. This may work as an ad hoc workaround, but it is not the correct Agent SDK configuration for production delegation.
Overall explanation
Correct configuration: In the Agent SDK, a coordinator invokes subagents through the Task tool, so allowedTools for the coordinator must include Task. Defining specialist agents is not enough if the coordinator is not permitted to call the mechanism that starts them.

Architectural principle: Keep orchestration authority with the coordinator while applying least privilege to the specialists. The coordinator should be able to spawn the relevant specialist, and each specialist should receive only the tools needed for its role.

Why the alternatives fail: Prompting the coordinator to mention specialist names is only natural-language guidance, not a real subagent invocation. Granting every specialist all backend MCP tools increases misuse risk and still does not solve the missing spawning mechanism. Running separate sessions manually sacrifices controlled handoff, recovery, and centralized routing.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. You added returns, billing, and account subagents. In test cases involving a damaged item plus a disputed late fee, the billing subagent asks the returns subagent about refund eligibility, the returns subagent replies directly, and the coordinator only sees the final billing summary. Audits now show missing rationale for why fees were waived, duplicate customer messages, and inconsistent escalation decisions. What orchestration change would best address this?
Give all subagents the full conversation history and complete tool access so they can independently resolve cross-cutting issues.
Explanation
Broad context and complete tool access increase decision complexity and weaken role boundaries. Subagents should receive explicit relevant context and scoped tools, while the coordinator manages cross-cutting issues and routes information between specialists.
Correct answer
Route every subagent handoff and result through the coordinator, which aggregates state, applies escalation rules, and delegates follow-up work.
Explanation
A coordinator-controlled hub-and-spoke pattern preserves observability, consistent error handling, and controlled information flow across specialized subagents. This directly addresses the missing rationale and inconsistent escalation decisions because the coordinator sees every intermediate result and decides the next delegation step.
Have each subagent independently escalate whenever its confidence drops, then merge all escalations into the final customer response.
Explanation
Self-reported confidence is an unreliable proxy for actual case complexity or escalation need. Independent escalation decisions also fragment the customer experience and undermine the coordinator's role in applying a consistent support policy.
Let specialized subagents call each other directly when they need context, reducing coordinator workload and shortening investigation paths.
Explanation
Direct subagent-to-subagent communication is the pattern causing the audit and consistency problems. It may reduce apparent latency, but it bypasses the component responsible for maintaining shared state, tracking rationale, and applying escalation policy consistently.
Overall explanation
Coordinator-subagent orchestration is most reliable when all inter-subagent communication flows through the coordinator. In this scenario, direct handoffs between specialized subagents hide intermediate reasoning, create duplicate customer-facing actions, and make escalation decisions inconsistent.

The correct architectural principle is a hub-and-spoke pattern: subagents perform specialized investigations, but the coordinator owns task decomposition, state aggregation, error handling, escalation policy, and final response synthesis. This gives the system a single control point for observability and customer experience while still allowing specialized work to happen in parallel or iteratively.

Allowing subagents to call each other directly is an anti-pattern because it creates opaque side channels. Giving every subagent full context and complete tool access weakens specialization and increases tool misuse risk. Confidence-triggered independent escalation is also unreliable because model confidence is not a calibrated measure of policy complexity or customer preference.

Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. In the repository for this support agent, a regression appears only in test fixture files whose filenames end with `.policy-case.json`. These fixtures are scattered across multiple service packages, and you want Claude Code to identify the affected files before inspecting their contents. Which approach is most appropriate?
Correct answer
Use Glob with `**/*.policy-case.json`, review the matched paths, then Read only the relevant fixture files.
Explanation
This is the most direct approach because the selection criterion is a filename pattern, not file contents. Glob is designed for path matching, and reading only the matched files keeps context focused and avoids unnecessary token usage.
Use Grep for `policy-case` across repository contents, then Read every file returned by the content search.
Explanation
Grep searches file contents, not paths, so it may miss files whose names match but whose contents do not contain the searched text. It also risks returning unrelated files that mention the string but are not the target fixtures.
Read all package directories recursively, then ask Claude to infer which filenames match the fixture naming convention.
Explanation
This is an anti-pattern because it loads broad, mostly irrelevant content before narrowing the search. It wastes context window space and makes the model do filename filtering after consuming unnecessary file contents.
Use Bash to run recursive file listing commands, then paste the complete output into the conversation for filtering.
Explanation
Bash can list files, but using it to dump large recursive output is less targeted than the built-in path matching tool. This adds unnecessary noise to context and relies on conversational filtering after producing excessive output.
Overall explanation
Use the tool that matches the selection criterion. When the problem is to find files by filename, extension, or path pattern, Glob is the appropriate built-in Claude Code tool. It returns matching paths first, allowing the workflow to inspect only relevant files with Read.

Grep is better for searching file contents, such as locating function names, error messages, or imports. Using Grep for a filename suffix can miss valid files or produce unrelated matches because it searches inside files rather than matching paths.

Context management matters. Dumping recursive listings through Bash or reading whole directories before narrowing scope creates avoidable noise and can degrade Claude's attention on the relevant fixture files. The practical pattern is to narrow with the most specific discovery tool first, then read or edit only the small set of files that matter.

Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. During consolidation of extracted obligations from 60 supplier contracts, the final dataset correctly groups duplicate obligations across documents. However, auditors cannot determine which contract clauses support each normalized obligation, and reviewers must reopen every source file to verify disputed entries. What change would best improve reliability without preventing consolidation?
Concatenate all document summaries before consolidation and ask Claude to regenerate citations for the final normalized obligations.
Explanation
Regenerating citations after summarization is unreliable because the source-to-claim relationship may already be lost. This anti-pattern can produce plausible-looking references that are difficult to verify against the original documents.
Keep only the highest-confidence extraction for each obligation and discard lower-confidence duplicates during the consolidation step.
Explanation
This loses corroborating evidence and makes the final record depend on a single selected source. Confidence scores are not a substitute for verifiable provenance, especially when auditors need to trace claims back to source clauses.
Store source document names at the batch level only, then rely on reviewers to infer relevant clauses when needed.
Explanation
Batch-level document names are too coarse for obligation-level verification. Reviewers still lack the specific clause, excerpt, or page reference needed to validate each normalized obligation efficiently.
Correct answer
Require each extracted obligation to carry source identifiers and excerpts, then merge duplicates while retaining every supporting reference.
Explanation
This preserves provenance while still allowing the system to normalize and consolidate duplicate obligations. Reviewers can inspect the exact source evidence for each combined finding without reopening every document manually.
Overall explanation
Correct approach: Multi-source synthesis should preserve provenance at the same granularity as the extracted finding. Each obligation should carry its source document, location, and supporting excerpt, and the consolidation step should merge duplicate obligations while retaining all supporting references.

Underlying principle: Consolidation and traceability are not opposites. A reliable architecture normalizes repeated findings for downstream use, while maintaining claim-to-source mappings so reviewers can audit, dispute, or reconcile each result.

Why the distractors fail: Keeping only the highest-confidence extraction discards useful corroboration and treats confidence as proof. Regenerating citations from summaries risks fabricated or misaligned references because provenance may have been compressed away. Batch-level source storage is too vague for field-level or obligation-level verification.

Scenario: Code Generation with Claude Code You are using Claude Code to accelerate software development. Your team uses it for code generation, refactoring, debugging, and documentation. You need to integrate it into your development workflow with custom slash commands, CLAUDE.md configurations, and understand when to use plan mode vs direct execution. Your frontend repo has component files under src/ui, packages/admin/widgets, and legacy/screens. The same accessibility and Storybook conventions were copied into several local instruction files, but updates drift and Claude misses conventions when editing new component folders. What should you change?
Create a custom slash command for component generation that includes conventions, and ask developers to remember using it.
Explanation
A slash command can help with an explicit workflow, but it will not automatically apply when Claude edits existing matching files during refactoring or debugging. Relying on developers to remember a command is a manual process, not conditional convention loading.
Correct answer
Create a repository rule file with YAML path globs matching component and story files, then remove duplicated directory instructions.
Explanation
Path-scoped rules are the right fit when a convention applies by file type or pattern rather than by a single directory tree. Glob patterns allow the same guidance to load automatically for matching files wherever they appear, reducing drift from duplicated local instructions.
Put all component conventions in the root CLAUDE.md and tell Claude to apply only relevant sections.
Explanation
A root CLAUDE.md would load the guidance broadly, including contexts where it is irrelevant. This increases always-loaded context and relies on Claude to infer applicability rather than using conditional path matching.
Add a CLAUDE.md file to every existing component directory and require maintainers to copy updates manually.
Explanation
Duplicating instructions across many directories is brittle and creates the drift already observed. It also fails when new component directories are created unless maintainers remember to add another local instruction file.
Overall explanation
Path-specific rule loading is designed for conventions that apply to files matching patterns across multiple locations, such as component files or Storybook files scattered through a repository. A rule file under .claude/rules/ can use YAML frontmatter with paths glob patterns so the guidance loads only when Claude works on matching files.

The architectural tradeoff is between automatic conditional loading and brittle manual duplication. Copying instructions into many local files creates drift, while a root CLAUDE.md loads too much guidance too often and depends on inference. A slash command is useful for intentional workflows, but it does not solve automatic convention application during arbitrary edits.

Use path-scoped rules when conventions span directories by file type or naming pattern, and reserve directory-level instruction files for conventions that truly belong to a specific subtree. Learn more in CLAUDE.md Configuration and the Claude Code Overview.

Scenario: Structured Data Extraction You are building a structured data extraction system using Claude. The system extracts information from unstructured documents, validates output using JSON schemas, and maintains high accuracy. It must handle edge cases gracefully and integrate with downstream systems. In a pilot, 6% of procurement packet extractions fail semantic validation because the required approval date is missing. Reviewer audit shows the provided PDFs say "approval letter on file," but the approval letters were not included in the model input. Retrying the same documents often produces plausible but unsupported dates. Which adjustment best improves extraction reliability?
Require the approval_date field and instruct Claude to infer it from nearby signature dates when no explicit date exists.
Explanation
Making the field required increases pressure to fabricate a value when the source does not contain the information. Inferring from nearby dates may produce plausible output, but it does not satisfy provenance or extraction accuracy requirements.
Correct answer
Detect source absence after validation, stop automated retries, mark extraction incomplete, and request the missing approval letter.
Explanation
Retries are useful when the model made a correctable format, placement, or structural error, but they cannot recover facts absent from the provided source. Marking the extraction incomplete and requesting the missing source prevents unsupported values from entering downstream systems.
Add examples of varied approval letter layouts and rerun extraction unchanged against the same uploaded procurement PDFs.
Explanation
Few-shot examples help when the relevant information exists in varied formats and the model is failing to recognize it. They do not solve cases where the approval letter itself was never provided to the model.
Retry failed documents up to five times with increasingly explicit prompts, then accept the most frequent date returned.
Explanation
This is an anti-pattern because arbitrary retry caps do not create missing evidence. Choosing the most frequent unsupported value can amplify hallucinations and make the output look more reliable than it is.
Overall explanation
Correct retry judgment: Validation and retry loops should distinguish recoverable extraction mistakes from missing-source conditions. If the required fact is not present in the supplied document set, additional retries against the same input cannot recover it and may produce unsupported values.

Underlying principle: Retry-with-feedback works for format mismatches, structural placement errors, or semantic validation issues where the source evidence exists. When the evidence is absent, the reliable behavior is to mark the extraction incomplete, preserve a clear reason such as missing_source, and request the missing document or route for review.

Why the distractors fail: Arbitrary retry caps and majority-vote selection can launder hallucinated values into apparently stable outputs. Required schema fields and inference instructions can pressure the model to invent facts. Few-shot examples improve recognition of information that is present, but they cannot compensate for an omitted source document.

Scenario: Claude Code for Continuous Integration You are integrating Claude Code into your CI/CD pipeline. The system runs automated code reviews, generates test cases, and provides feedback on pull requests. You need to design prompts that provide actionable feedback and minimize false positives. Recent PR review runs produce noisy findings when a pull request touches only Markdown docs or CSS files. Claude still applies backend transaction rules, API error-handling rules, and database migration standards, which increases context size and creates irrelevant comments. What configuration change best reduces this noise while keeping review guidance automatic?
Keep every convention in root CLAUDE.md, adding instructions that Claude should ignore sections unrelated to each pull request.
Explanation
A root CLAUDE.md file is always loaded as broad project context, so it does not reduce irrelevant context for narrow pull requests. Asking Claude to ignore unrelated sections relies on inference after the extra guidance has already consumed context and influenced review behavior.
Split the CI job into separate review commands per language, manually selecting one command based on changed filenames.
Explanation
Separate commands can become brittle and difficult to maintain, especially for pull requests that touch multiple file types. This shifts convention selection into CI orchestration instead of using Claude Code's built-in conditional rule loading mechanism.
Add a shorter maximum prompt budget for CI reviews, truncating convention text whenever the pull request appears simple.
Explanation
Arbitrary truncation is an anti-pattern because it may remove the exact convention needed for the changed files. It reduces tokens by discarding context unpredictably rather than loading the right context deliberately.
Correct answer
Move specialized guidance into .claude/rules/ files with YAML paths globs so only rules relevant to changed files load.
Explanation
Path-scoped rule files are designed to load conditionally based on matching file paths, which keeps irrelevant guidance out of the active context. This directly reduces token usage and false positives while preserving automatic rule application during CI review.
Overall explanation
Path-scoped rules let teams place topic-specific guidance in .claude/rules/ files and use YAML frontmatter such as paths with glob patterns to control when each rule is active. This works well for CI reviews because Claude receives only the conventions relevant to the files under review, reducing irrelevant context, token usage, and noisy findings.

The underlying principle is conditional context loading: important standards should be available when applicable, but absent when they would distract the model or create false positives. Keeping all conventions in a root CLAUDE.md loads everything for every review, while asking Claude to ignore irrelevant sections still leaves that content in context.

Manually routing CI jobs by file type duplicates logic outside Claude Code and becomes fragile for mixed pull requests. Truncating guidance based on perceived simplicity is also unreliable because it can remove critical rules unpredictably.

Question 60
Skipped
Scenario: Customer Support Resolution Agent You are building a customer support resolution agent using the Claude Agent SDK. The agent handles high-ambiguity requests like returns, billing disputes, and account issues. It has access to backend systems through MCP tools (get_customer, lookup_order, process_refund, escalate_to_human). Your target is 80%+ first-contact resolution while knowing when to escalate. During integration testing, a billing-dispute case starts well: Claude requests get_customer, your service executes it successfully, and the tool returns a verified customer record. The next user-facing message, however, is generated by your application from that raw tool payload, so no order lookup, refund decision, or escalation decision occurs. What change best fixes the control-flow design?
Correct answer
Run an agentic loop that inspects stop_reason, executes requested tools, appends tool results, and repeats until end_turn.
Explanation
This implements the core agentic loop lifecycle: request, inspect why Claude stopped, execute tools when requested, return tool results, and continue. It lets Claude reason over the verified customer record before deciding whether to look up orders, process a refund, or escalate.
Template a final customer response from the first completed tool result, using returned backend fields directly.
Explanation
This bypasses Claude's reasoning after the tool result is available, which is exactly why later decisions are missing. Tool outputs are intermediate context for the next model turn, not a substitute for the agent's final decision process.
Keep calling Claude while assistant text includes question marks, uncertainty phrases, or unresolved customer-facing language.
Explanation
Parsing natural language text to decide whether the loop should continue is an anti-pattern. Assistant wording is not a reliable control signal, while stop_reason explicitly indicates whether tool execution is needed or the turn is complete.
Limit each request to three tool iterations, then summarize collected results and ask the customer to confirm.
Explanation
An arbitrary iteration cap can be a safety backstop, but it should not be the primary completion condition. Some cases may finish after one tool call, while others legitimately require more steps before a correct final response.
Overall explanation
The correct control-flow design is to use an agentic loop: send the request to Claude, inspect stop_reason, execute requested tools when the value is tool_use, append matching tool_result blocks to the conversation, and repeat until Claude returns end_turn.

This matters because tool results are not final answers by themselves. In the billing-dispute example, the verified customer record is new context that Claude needs before deciding whether to call lookup_order, process_refund, or escalate_to_human.

Generating a response directly from the first tool payload short-circuits the agent's reasoning. Parsing assistant text for uncertainty is also unreliable because natural language is not a stable lifecycle signal. Arbitrary iteration limits may be useful as guardrails, but they should not replace the explicit stop_reason based termination condition.
