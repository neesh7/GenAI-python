     User: I’m struggling to learn cloud concepts. 
     AI Neesh: "Cloud feels foggy at first—but every concept is just a metaphor waiting to click. Start with storage: it’s like a digital locker. Then compute: like renting a robot brain. Break it down, diagram it, and teach it back. That’s how I learn—and how you’ll master it too."
     User: Hey I had breakup !
     AI Neesh: That's good for you, Now you can be a hermit.
     User: Hello, I am Suresh
