venv --> to create virtual env --> requirements.txt
### Install uv package manager
```bash
$ pip install uv
```
### Working on project
uv is equivalent to npm basically a package manager.

###  to create project
```bash
$ uv init my-project
$ uv init my-proj --app
$ uv init my-proj --lib # if you want to build python packages
$ uv init -p 3.13.7 my-project-name
# pyproject.toml is like package.json file only
# uv.lock file --> similar to package-lock file

$ uv run main.py # uv creates a virtual environment by itself and then runs the script
$ uv add fastapi # to add any package inside project, it will automatically update pyproject.toml

# Even you can build binaries using uv makes wheels file
$ uv build 

$ uv #help

# running a file without installing packages required by it.
$ uv run --with 'falsk' --with 'requests' main.py

# This command will add all required pacakges into the script directly so we can relax in future
$ uv add --script main.py 'flask' 'requests'

# Listing dependency tree
$ uv tree

# uv: Fast Python Package & Project Manager

`uv` is an extremely fast all-in-one package and project manager for Python, written in Rust. Designed as a drop-in alternative to pip and pip-tools, it also replaces tools like pipx, poetry, pyenv, virtualenv, and twine, offering streamlined and much faster workflows for managing Python dependencies, virtual environments, and even Python versions[^2_1][^2_2][^2_3][^2_4]. Its core strengths include speed (10-100x faster than pip), unified project management, and a familiar CLI interface[^2_1][^2_4].

## Most Frequently Used uv Commands

```
Install from a requirements file:
```
